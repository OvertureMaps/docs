A summary of those changes, below:\\n\\n- we added a `subclass` property that refines the descriptions of segments by:\\n  - clearly specifying the usage of a length of road and using linear referencing, instead of further segmentation, to pinpoint a change in how the road is used\\n  - properly classifying information from OpenStreetMap\\n\\n- to better support routing use cases, we added to the segment feature type a new property called `connectors`: an array of IDs with pre-computed linear reference values that explicitly link segment geometry with connector coordinates. This new property\u2014a replacement for the existing `connector_ids` property\u2014will reduce complexity and improve accuracy as we calculate the intersections between segments and connectors.\\n\\n- we added a `destinations` property to the segment feature type. This property describes the transitions from one segment to another on the way to a specified location\\n\\nYou can read more about these changes on the [engineering blog](https://docs.overturemaps.org/blog/2024/08/15/preview-august-release/).\\n\\n\\n## Deprecations\\n\\nIn this release, we deprecated the `connector_ids` property in the transportation schema and plan to remove it by the October release.

The transportation theme remains in beta, and users can anticipate additional breaking changes to the transportation schema. Also in this release, we launched a new theme called addresses, available in alpha. We will be making significant changes to the addresses schema and updating and adding to the addresses data over the next several months.\\n\\nThe datasets are available as GeoParquet files stored on AWS and Azure. The release paths are:\\n\\n#### Microsoft Azure:\\n```\\nwasbs://release@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2024-07-22.0\\n```\\n\\n#### Amazon S3:\\n```\\ns3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-07-22.0\\n```\\n\\nYou can access the datasets by following the process outlined [here](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/). We encourage users to report bugs and provide feedback on the data, schema, and GERS on one of our Overture GitHub repositories:\\n\\n- [Schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema)\\n- [Data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data)\\n- [Docs](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/docs)\\n- [Python command-line tool](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py)\\n- [Explore site](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/io-site)\\n\\n## New theme: addresses\\n\\nIn this release, we added a new theme called [addresses](/schema/reference/addresses/address) that includes over 200 million address features for 14 countries. We are releasing this theme in alpha and anticipate significant changes over the next several releases. We invite the Overture community to test the addresses schema and data and offer feedback via the [data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/issues) and [schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/issues) repos.\\n\\n\\n## Breaking changes\\n\\nIn the divisions theme, we changed the `boundary` feature type to `division_boundary`. Feature types in Overture must be distinct and unique across all themes, and `boundary` did not meet those conditions. We realize that changing the name of a feature type is a major change, and we do not anticipate doing this again without giving our users plenty of advance notice. \\n\\nAlso in the divisions theme, we changed the `divisions` property to `divisions_ids` to fix relationship modeling in the schema. The logic is that a property or nested sub-property that contains a foreign key reference to another feature by Overture ID must end in the suffix `_id`. More information about this change here: https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/pull/215\\n\\nWe removed `update_time` from a top-level schema property to a property within the sources structure. For example, the Microsoft buildings `update_time` comes from Microsoft\'s imagery capture data:\\n```\\n[{property=, dataset=Microsoft ML Buildings, record_id=709fc8cf0b55, update_time=2023-06-23T00:00:00.000Z, confidence=null}]\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Deprecations\\n\\nIn the transportation theme, we deprecated the `road` JSON column in the June release and removed it in the current release.

This hotfix addressed the following regressions:\\n- in the transportation theme, a bug in one of our automated processes inadvertently caused the conversion of unicode characters to ASCII. This affected roughly 10% of `segment` features that contained characters outside of the ASCII range, primarily names but possibly things like speed limit/weight restrictions if those properties contained values with characters outside that range.\\n- in the buildings theme, the `roof_height` property was not fully populated; the hotfix adds 143k `roof_height` values to the release. \\n\\nThe new release paths are:\\n```\\nAzure path: wasbs://release@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2024-06-13-beta.1\\n\\nAWS path: s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-06-13-beta.1\\n```\\n:::\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverture\'s `2024-06-13-beta.0` release is available in GeoParquet and stored on AWS and Azure.

Parking garages, for example, now have the attributes: `subtype=transportation`, `class=parking`; example of new subtypes, promoted from class: `agricultural`, `civic`, `commercial`, `education`, `entertainment`, `industrial`, `medical`, `military`, `outbuilding`, `religious`, `residential`, `service`, `transportation`\\n- made incremental updates from OSM since the previous release\\n\\n**Places**\\n\\n- made incremental changes to improve the accuracy and quality of the dataset\\n\\n**Transportation**\\n\\n- added missing vehicle travel mode\\n- added missing `is_covered` road flag\\n- populated `is_abandoned` flag when relevant abandoned or disused tags are present\\n- added OSM source ids for connectors\\n- fixed null linear referencing for names in some cases\\n\\n### Attribution\\n\\nYou\'ll find information about attribution and licensing [here](https://docs.overturemaps.org/attribution/)."},{"id":"2024-04-16-beta.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/release/2024-04-16-beta.0","source":"@site/release-blog/2024-beta/2024-04-16-beta.0.mdx","title":"2024-04-16-beta.0","description":"Highlights","date":"2024-04-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"2024-04-16-beta.0","slug":"2024-04-16-beta.0"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"2024-05-16-beta.0","permalink":"/release/2024-05-16-beta.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"2024-03-12-alpha.0","permalink":"/release/2024-03-12-alpha.0"}},"content":"### Highlights\\nHere are the highlights for what\'s new and updated in the Overture Maps `2024-04-16-beta.0` release.

The overall purpose of this new theme is to allow users to create a complete map using any Overture release. Descriptions of the subTypes for Base are:\\n- land: Physical representations of land surfaces. Derived from the inverse of OSM Coastlines.\\n- landUse: Classifications of the human use of a section of land. Mostly derived from the key landuse in OpenStreetMap\\n- water: Physical representations of inland and ocean marine surfaces. Derived from OSM Coastlines, and the keys natural and waterway in OpenStreetMap.\\n\\nAll of the features in the base theme are from OpenStreetMap, sourced via the Daylight Map Distribution. Original OSM tags remain on all features. Some tags become top-level properties, such as the surface or wikidata tags.\\n\\nData in the Base theme is licensed under ODbL.\\n\\n**Buildings Theme**\\nThe dataset includes 1.39B conflated building footprints from OSM, Esri Community Maps, and Microsoft ML Building Footprints. This is an increase of ~700M building footprints from the July Alpha release by including the complete Microsoft ML Building footprint dataset.\\n\\nThe order of conflation is OpenStreetMap > Esri Community Maps > Microsoft ML Building Footprints. For example, if Esri has a building that does not exist in OSM, we take that building, then, we \\"fill-in\\" the rest of the map with any Microsoft ML buildings that do not intersect with either OSM or Esri.\\n\\n:::note\\nA sample set of 1.6M buildings from OpenStreetMap and Esri have been assigned an initial GERS ID for demonstration purposes. These IDs are 32 character strings. By referencing these other datasets to this data release, we can match GERS IDs to external datasets and demonstrate how GERS can enable ID-based joins between two geospatial datasets. These are located in the following cities:\\n- United States: Seattle, Washington; Macon, Georgia; Charleston, South Carolina; Spokane, Washington\\n- Canada: Kingston, Ontario\\n- Netherlands: Leeuwarden, Friesland\\n- Germany: Berlin\\n- Brazil: Rio De Janeiro\\n\\nFor a deeper look at how GERS is used to link datasets on this data, see [this blog post from Deane Kensok at Esri](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/mapping/enriching-overture-data-with-gers/).\\n:::\\n\\nThe sources include OpenStreetMap, Microsoft Building footprints, and Esri Community Partners. Some building heights have also been derived using lidar from USGS 3DEP. The Building data is in the Overture Maps data schema for Buildings.\\n\\nData in the Buildings theme is licensed under ODbL.\\n\\n**Administrative Boundaries (Admins) Theme**\\nThe Admins theme includes multiple locality types:\\n- Countries formed from OpenStreetMap relations, primarily admin_level=2, with few exceptions such as admin_level=3 French Polynesia.\\n- First-level subdivisions under the country which was mapped from OpenStreetMap admin_level depending on country, in most countries admin_level=4.\\n- Second-level subdivisions under the country which was mapped from OpenStreetMap admin_level depending on country, in most countries admin_level=6.\\n- Cities, Town, Villages, Neighborhoods... based on place=* tag. In most cases these are just points. When relation with place=* tag exist we provide polygon geometry.\\n\\nIt also includes administrative boundaries representing borders of countries, first-level subdivisions and second-level subdivisions. The Administrative Boundary data is in the Overture Maps data schema for Admin.\\nSecond-level subdivision did not undergo worldwide inspection of quality so some missing or wrong data is expected. All first-level subdivisions have `type=state` and all second-level subdivisions have `type=county` which is not always true; we plan to address this issue in future releases. We plan to use admin_level=8,9,10 to add polygons to cities, town, villages and other localities when available depending on individual country mapping.\\n\\nData in the Admin theme is licensed under ODbL. The sources of the admin theme are OpenStreetMap and Esri.\\n\\n**Places Theme**\\nThis release has over 57M place records. The Places theme in this release includes several modifications to improve the accuracy and quality of the dataset:\\n- Increased deduplication on significant landmarks by revising the screening criteria for signals based on check-ins only\\n- Removal of places determined to be non-existent\\n- Address normalization bug fix that was yielding incorrect pin locations. In addition, support for website, phone and category was added to the Microsoft sourced data.\\n- Some additional place records were added as a result of tuning of the algorithms.\\n\\nData in the Places theme is licensed under CDLA Permissive 2.0.\\n\\n**Transportation Theme**\\nThe Transportation theme includes the following improvements:\\n- Collective OSM changes through September 15th, updated and converted to Overture\'s Schema.\\n- Addition of Linear Referenced features, enabling the description of properties that apply along only portions of a segment.\\n- Over 1.3 million turn restrictions worldwide\\n- Additional scoping types populated in the Transportation data, including Travel Modes, Temporal Scoping, Geometric Scoping, and Heading\\n- Additional properties populated in the Transportation data, including Speed Limits, surface, and road flags.\\n\\n:::note\\nThere are several missing properties in this data release that will be added in future releases:\\n- Only includes road segments made from Ways that include a \u2018highway\u2019 tag\\n- Non-geometric scoping properties are not included\\n- Turn and Access restrictions are not included\\n- Lane information is not included\\n- Some language/scripts are not included in names properties\\n:::\\n\\n:::note\\nThe data includes some provisional Global Entity Reference System (GERS) data which is used to express relationships between road segments.

The Building data is in the Overture Maps data schema for Buildings.\\n\\nData in the Buildings theme is licensed under ODbL.\\n\\n**Transportation Theme**\\nThe transportation theme includes road networks data based on OpenStreetMap.  This release is a demonstration of our Shape and Connectivity model of the transportation network, and also showcases how Geometric Scoping (LR) interacts with a subset of the final properties. The data has been put into the Overture Maps data schema for transportation.  As such, the data has been re-segmented and structured with some conditional attributes.
