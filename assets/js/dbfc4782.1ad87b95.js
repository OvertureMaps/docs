In this blog post, we\'ll walk you through the components of the GERS \\"system\\" show you how to ask new questions of Overture data. \\n\\n## Understanding GERS IDs\\nAs of the June 2025 release, all GERS IDs are UUIDs: 128-bit, randomly-generated identifiers ([UUID v4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122)) that Overture keeps stable across data releases and updates. These IDs are stored as strings with dashes: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`. \\n\\nFor this release only, we\'re providing Parquet files that map GERS IDs from the May release to the new GERS UUIDs in June release. These files are partitioned by `theme` and \'type\' and can be accessed here: `s3://overturemaps-extras-us-west-2/june_to_may_id_mapping/`\\n\\n## Exploring Overture\'s `divisions` and `hierarchies` with GERS\\n\\n Let\'s start by exploring how GERS IDs work in one Overture dataset. The `divisions` theme contains administrative boundaries and points for global administrative areas. In this example, we\'ll use DuckDB to connect to Azure and read the Parquet files from Azure blob storage. You can also access the files on Amazon S3.\\n\\n    ```sql\\n    CREATE TABLE slc AS (\\n        SELECT\\n            *\\n        FROM\\n            read_parquet(\'az://overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/release/2025-06-25.0/theme=divisions/type=division/*\')\\n        WHERE\\n            -- ID for Salt Lake City, Utah\\n            id = \'c85948de-26de-4c4a-8479-1dac33fa8b04\'\\n    );\\n    ```\\n\\nWhen we query that table, we can see the `divisions` hierarchy: Salt Lake City is a locality in Salt Lake County, which is in the region of Utah, within the country of the United States.\\n\\n    ```sql\\n    SELECT\\n        h.name,\\n        h.subtype,\\n        h.division_id\\n    FROM\\n        slc\\n    CROSS JOIN UNNEST(hierarchies[1]) AS t(h);\\n    ```\\n\\nIf we wanted to retrieve the actual polygons for the administrative boundaries, we can search the `division_area` type of the `divisions` theme to obtain these particular `division` IDs:\\n\\n    ```sql\\n    COPY(\\n        SELECT\\n            names.primary AS name,\\n            subtype,\\n            id,\\n            geometry\\n        FROM\\n            read_parquet(\'az://overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/release/2025-06-25.0/theme=divisions/type=division_area/*\') areas\\n        WHERE\\n            division_id IN (\\n                SELECT\\n                    h.division_id\\n                FROM\\n                    slc\\n                CROSS JOIN UNNEST(hierarchies[1]) AS t(h)\\n            )\\n    ) TO \'slc_hierarchies.geojson\' WITH (FORMAT GDAL, DRIVER GeoJSON);\\n    ```\\n\\nNext we\'ll load `slc_hierarchies.geojson` into [KeplerGL](https://kepler.gl/) so that we can see the complete hierarchy of divisions.\\n\\nGERS IDs are intended to be the key to unlock interoperability both inside and outside of Overture data. This example showed how Overture features within the same theme can reference one-another via GERS.\\n\\n## 2. Looking up IDs in the GERS Registry\\n\\nLet\'s grab the GERS IDs for a couple landmarks and places in Salt Lake City and look them up in the GERS Registry. \\n\\n<details>\\n    <summary>\\nThe UUID for the Utah State Capitol is `d724e74f-017a-4902-9031-bc784ffc1789`. Is that part of GERS?\\n    </summary>\\n\\nYes! We can search for that `id` in the GERS Registry with this query:\\n\\n```\\nSELECT \\n   *\\nFROM read_parquet(\'https://overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/registry/2025-06.25.0/\')    \\nWHERE id=\'d724e74f-017a-4902-9031-bc784ffc1789\';\\n```\\nWe can see that it\'s a `place` type that was first seen by the [GERS Registry](/gers/registry) in June 2025. This makes sense because the GERS Registry didn\'t exist to _see_ any features before that. \\n</details>\\n\\n\\n<details>\\n    <summary>\\nWhat\'s the UUID for the Great Salt Lake? Is it part of the GERS Registry?\\n    </summary>\\n\\n</details>\\n\\n\\n## 3. Using the data changelog\\n\\n:::note\\nFor the next part of this tutorial, we\'re using artifacts from the May release (`2025-05-21.0`). Because of the switch to UUIDs in June, we did not generate a changelog in June. The next changelog will be published with the July release.\\n:::\\n\\nEvery Overture release (except the June 2025 release) includes a [changelog](/gers/changelog) with a high level overview of data added, removed, or changed, based on the ID. The changelog is partitioned by `theme`, `type`, and `change_type`. Let\'s use the changelog to identify all of the features added in Salt Lake City in Overture\'s May release.\\n\\n    ```sql\\n    SELECT\\n        id\\n    FROM\\n        read_parquet(\'s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/changelog/2025-05-21.0/theme=places/*/*/*.parquet\')\\n    WHERE\\n        change_type = \'added\'\\n        AND bbox.xmin > -112.461 AND bbox.xmax < -111.073\\n        AND bbox.ymin > 40.296 AND bbox.ymax < 40.955\\n    ```\\n\\nNext we can join this list of new places to the `places` theme by `id` and write out a new GeoJSON file:\\n\\n    ```sql\\n    COPY(\\n        SELECT\\n            places.id as id,\\n            names.primary as name,\\n            categories.primary as category,\\n            confidence,\\n            CAST(sources AS JSON) as sources,\\n            geometry\\n        FROM\\n            read_parquet(\'s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2025-05-21.0/theme=places/type=place/*\') places\\n        JOIN (\\n            SELECT\\n                id\\n            FROM\\n                read_parquet(\'s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/changelog/2025-05-21.0/theme=places/*/*/*.parquet\')\\n            WHERE change_type = \'added\'\\n            AND bbox.xmin > -112.461 AND bbox.xmax < -111.073 AND bbox.ymin > 40.296 AND bbox.ymax < 40.955\\n            ) changelog\\n        ON places.id = changelog.id\\n        ORDER BY places.id ASC\\n    ) TO \'new_places_slc_may.geojson\' WITH (FORMAT GDAL, DRIVER GeoJSON);\\n    ```\\n\\nWe could go one step further and query the one-time May to June ID mapping to translate our list of IDs from the May release to the new UUIDs in June. Here\'s how we would do that:\\n\\n```\\n COPY (SELECT\\n        id\\n    FROM\\n        read_parquet(\'s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/changelog/2025-05-21.0/theme=places/*/*/*.parquet\')\\n    WHERE\\n        change_type = \'added\'\\n        AND bbox.xmin > -112.461 AND bbox.xmax < -111.073\\n        AND bbox.ymin > 40.296 AND bbox.ymax < 40.955\\n    ) TO \'added_places_slc_may.parquet\'\\n\\n\\n CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS oldIDs AS\\n (SELECT\\n oldIDs.id\\n FROM read_parquet(\'added_places_slc_may.parquet\')\\n JOIN\\n (SELECT \\n * \\n FROM read_parquet (\'s3://overturemaps-extras-us-west-2/june_to_may_id_mapping/theme=places/type=place/*\'\') newUUIDs\\n ON \\n oldIDs.id = newUUIDs.previous_id\\n TO \'added_places_slc_june.geojson\' WITH (FORMAT GDAL, DRIVER GeoJSON);\\n\\n  ```\\n\\n## 4. Using bridge files\\n\\n[Bridge files](/gers/bridge-files) are published mappings of GERS ID to Source IDs for Overture features that came from an established dataset with a meaningful `record_id`. ML-Derived buildings, for example, do not have stable meaningful input IDs, but place records from Meta have corresponding IDs that reference public Facebook pages.\\n\\nThe `sources` property lists the original source of the data and any additional properties that Overture has added. We can use the bridge file for Meta\'s places data to map the GERS ID back to the source ID. Then we can look upthe Facebook pages for the new places in Salt Lake City:\\n\\n    ```sql\\n    COPY(\\n        SELECT\\n            \'https://facebook.com/\' || cast(bridge.record_id as varchar) AS facebook_page,\\n            slc_places.*\\n        FROM ST_READ(\'results/new_places_slc.geojson\') slc_places JOIN (\\n            SELECT\\n                id,\\n                record_id\\n            FROM\\n                read_parquet(\'s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/bridgefiles/2025-05-21.0/dataset=meta/theme=places/type=place/*\')\\n        ) bridge ON slc_places.id = bridge.id\\n        LIMIT 100\\n    ) TO \'results/new_places_slc_with_fb_pages.geojson\' WITH (FORMAT GDAL, Driver GeoJSON);\\n    ```"},{"id":"2025-06-25.0","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2025-06-25.0","source":"@site/blog/2025/2025-06-25.0.mdx","title":"2025-06-25.0 release notes","description":"Overview","date":"2025-06-25T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"releases","permalink":"/blog/tags/releases"}],"readingTime":3.51,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"2025-06-25.0 release notes","slug":"2025-06-25.0","tags":["releases"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Using the GERS \\"system\\"","permalink":"/blog/2025/06/25/getting-started-gers"},"nextItem":{"title":"2025-05-21.0 release notes","permalink":"/blog/2025-05-21.0"}},"content":"import Tabs from \'@theme/Tabs\';\\nimport TabItem from \'@theme/TabItem\';\\nimport QueryBuilder from \'@site/src/components/queryBuilder\';\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\n**The `2025-06-25.0` release of Overture data and `v1.10.0` of the Overture schema are now available.** We\'re pleased to annouce that GERS is now in GA!

Big changes to GERS. \\n\\nIn this release, Overture has standardized the [`id` property](/schema/#top-level-properties) across all themes by adopting [UUIDs](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9562.html), stored as strings. This is a **one-time** breaking change for our ID system. For this release only, we are offering Parquet files, partioned by `theme` and `type` that map the old May IDs to the new June UUIDs.  You can find that file here: `s3://overturemaps-extras-us-west-2/june_to_may_id_mapping/`.\\n\\nOverture is now producing bridge files with each release.

Bridge files!\\n\\nOverture is now releasing bridge files alongside our monthly data releases. Bridge files map GERS IDs to source data IDs, providing a mechanism to trace the origin of data in the Overture corpus, including data that doesn\'t appear in our published releases.\\n\\nOverture\'s approach to conflation is to handle the complexity internally and deliver fully conflated, interoperable data products. We publish this conflated data every month but we haven\'t previously made our internal GERS ID matching available. Bridge files change this by sharing our conflation results, making it easier for you to understand data provenance and giving you an opportunity to be more provider-agnostic.\\n\\nYou can find the latest bridge files here, partitioned by dataset, theme, and type:\\n\\n```\\nwasbs://bridgefiles@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2025-05-21.0\\n```\\n```\\ns3://overturemaps-us-west-2/bridgefiles/2025-05-21.0\\n```\\n\\n## GERS IDs will become UUIDs in June\\n\\nIn next month\'s release (late June), Overture is standardizing the [`id` property](/schema/#top-level-properties) across all themes by adopting [UUIDs](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9562.html), stored as strings. \\n\\nCurrently the structure of our IDs varies slightly across datasets, with some themes embedding metadata (e.g. [H3](https://h3geo.org/)) in the `id` property. The new UUIDs will be randomly-generated identifiers with no encoded information. Moving to UUIDs enables consistent ID generation and registration across our data pipelines, which is necessary for the successful implementation of [GERS](/gers). \\n\\nThis is a **one-time** breaking change for our ID system. We plan to support our users by providing a file that maps the old IDs to the new UUIDs.\\n\\n\\n## Theme-specific updates\\n\\n:::info\\nThe base, buildings, divisions, places, and transportation themes are in GA.

This post provides a brief roadmap of the work we\u2019ve done to reach that goal, along with a request for our community to continue testing the data and providing valuable feedback.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about what GA means for the transportation theme. We have a few guiding principles:\\n\\n1. There are no \\"trust violations\\" in the schema and data. It needs to \\"just work\\" when a developer writes code based on our schema and documentation.\\n2. The road geometry and attributes should be on par with the roads in OSM.\\n3. Roads have stable GERS IDs and those IDs can be references for attaching additional data.\\n4. The road features we capture should support our core use cases: rendering for display, GERS referencing, and basic routing capabilities.\\n\\nMost of our work over the past few months has been around #1 and #2. We\'ve been resolving data-schema violations by fixing inconsistencies in our schema and issues with the data transformation steps in our pipeline. To satisfy #3, we\u2019ve been monitoring changes in GERS IDs from release to release, and our metrics show the vast majority of roads are maintaining stable IDs.\\n\\nWe\'ve had to break a few things in our schema to make way for improvements:\\n\\n- To better support routing use cases, we added to the segment feature type a new property called `connectors`: an array of IDs with pre-computed linear reference values that explicitly link segments and connector features via coordinates. Each connector is a possible routing decision point, meaning it defines a place along the segment in which there is possibility to transition to other segments that share the same connector. This new property \u2014 a replacement for the old `connector_ids` property \u2014 will reduce complexity and improve accuracy as we calculate the intersections between segment and connector features. You can read more about this improvement [here](https://docs.overturemaps.org/blog/2024/08/15/preview-august-release/#transportation-schema-changes).\\n\\n- In the [November release](https://docs.overturemaps.org/release/2024-11-13.0/), we removed `lanes` from the schema to eliminate a significant trust violation. The `lanes` property has existed in the schema for months but we never populated it with data in our releases, which is a poor experience for our community. We intend to redesign `lanes` in the coming months.\\n\\nWith these changes, we are confident we\u2019ve met our requirements for general availability (GA). We\'ll continue refining our schema and improving our data throughout 2025. We encourage our community to keep the feedback coming, particularly around data quality and our core use cases of map display, routing, and matching data via GERS.\\n\\nHere are some specific ways you can help:\\n\\n1. Examine Overture transportation data in your areas of interest and compare it to local sources of data. Bonus: combine transportation data with Overture places, buildings, and base data to make a map. Here are some suggestions for downloading data using [Overture\'s Python CLI](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/overturemaps-py/).\\n\\nPhiladelphia area\\n```\\noverturemaps download --bbox=-75.8264,39.7032,-74.5213,40.444 -f geoparquet --type=segment -o overture-segments-philadelphia.geoparquet\\n```\\n\\nRiyadh Province, Saudia Arabia\\n```\\noverturemaps download --bbox=38.97,21.33,48.66,25.98 -f geoparquet --type=segment -o overture-segments-riyadh.geoparquet\\n```\\n\\nCampobasso, Italy\\n```\\noverturemaps download --bbox=13.8152,40.8473,15.6336,42.0773 -f geoparquet --type=segment -o overture-segments-campobasso.geoparquet\\n```\\n\\n2. Test our [transportation spitter tool](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/transportation-splitter) and help us improve it. PRs are welcome! \\n\\n3. Feed our data into a routing engine and let us know how it goes. Paul Ramsey from Crunchy Data shared [a vehicle routing example using PostGIS and Overture data](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/vehicle-routing-with-postgis-and-overture-data). We\'d like to see our users trying [Valhalla](https://valhalla.github.io/valhalla/) and [Graphhopper](https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper-maps) too. We are considering building a native Overture router and/or adding support to an existing open source router, such as Valhalla and Grasshopper, so that Overture consumers can easily use transportation data out of the box.\\n\\n4.

In this post, we\'ll give you a preview of three key improvements to the transportation schema in the August\\nrelease, **which will be available next week**.\\n\\n## Transportation schema changes\\nThe schema changes we plan to implement over the next few releases will better support routing and map\\ndisplay use cases, and make it easier for our users to integrate Overture transportation data into their\\npipelines and products. These improvements are necessary if we are to achieve our goal of a GA release in October.\\nHere are the steps we\'re taking in the August release to move us toward that goal.\\n\\n### Subclasses\\n\\n| ![Diagram of class and subclass structures](/img/blog/class-subclass-diagram.png) |\\n|:--:|\\n| *A diagram of the new class and subclass structures* |\\n\\nWe [added a new `subclass` property](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/pull/180) that refines the descriptions of segments by:\\n\\n- clearly specifying the usage of a length of road, and using linear referencing instead of further segmentation to pinpoint a change in how the road is used\\n- properly classifying detailed information from OpenStreetMap\\n\\nSubclasses require non-overlapping geometries, which will make it easier for routing engines to consume our\\nroad data and generate turn-by-turn directions. The new class and subclass structures allow us to capture more\\ninformation about roads from our data sources. For example, we\u2019ve been able\\nto move more than 30 million \u201cunknown\u201d road segments from OSM into the new subclasses, laying the groundwork\\nfor richer and more detailed map displays with Overture data.\\n\\nHere\'s how class, subclasses, and flags are modeled in the [Overture schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/blob/main/schema/transportation/segment.yaml):\\n\\n```yaml\\nclass: footway\\nsubclass_rules:\\n  - value: sidewalk\\n    between: [0, 0.6]\\n  - value: crosswalk\\n    between: [0.6, 1.0]\\nroad_flags:\\n  - values: [is_bridge]\\n    between: [0.2, 0.3]\\n  - values: [is_under_construction]\\n    between: [0.3, 0.5]\\n\\nclass: service\\nsubclass_rules:\\n  - value: driveway\\n    between: [0, 0.5]\\n\\nclass: primary\\nsubclass: link\\nsubclass_rules:\\n  - value: link\\n```\\n\\n### Connectors\\nTo better support routing use cases, we added to the segment feature type [a new property](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/pull/257) called\\n`connectors`: an array of IDs with pre-computed linear reference values that explicitly link segments and\\n[connector features](https://docs.overturemaps.org/schema/reference/transportation/connector/) via coordinates. The `connectors` property contains a list of connector features to which a segment feature is physically connected and the relative location of those connector features along the segment. Each connector is a possible routing decision point, meaning it defines a place along the segment in which there is possibility to transition to other segments that share the same connector.\\n\\nThis new property &mdash; a replacement for the existing `connector_ids`\\nproperty &mdash; will reduce complexity and improve accuracy as we calculate the intersections between segment and connector features. We plan to deprecate the `connector_ids` property in the August release and remove it from the schema in the October release.\\n\\nHere are examples from the Overture schema comparing the new and deprecated features:\\n<Tabs>\\n<TabItem value=\\"connectors\\" label=\\"new connectors property\\" default>\\n```yaml\\nid: overture:transportation:segment:123\\ntype: Feature\\ngeometry:\\n  type: LineString\\n  coordinates: [[0, 0], [0.03, 0], [0.10, 0]]\\nproperties:\\n  theme: transportation\\n  type: segment\\n  version: 1\\n  subtype: road\\n  class: secondary\\n  connectors:\\n    - connector_id: fooConnector\\n      at: 0\\n    - connector_id: barConnector\\n      at: 0.3\\n    - connector_id: bazConnector\\n      at: 1\\n  road_surface:\\n    - value: paved\\n```\\n</TabItem>\\n<TabItem value=\\"connector_ids\\" label=\\"deprecated connector_ids property\\" default>\\n```yaml\\nid: overture:transportation:segment:123\\ntype: Feature\\ngeometry:\\n  type: LineString\\n  coordinates: [[0, 0], [0.03, 0], [0.10, 0]]\\nproperties:\\n  theme: transportation\\n  type: segment\\n  version: 1\\n  subtype: road\\n  class: secondary\\n  connector_ids: [fooConnector, barConnector, bazConnector]\\n  road_surface:\\n    - value: paved\\n```\\n</TabItem>\\n</Tabs>\\n\\n### Destinations\\n\\n| ![Highway signs](/img/blog/highway-signs.png) |\\n|:--:|\\n| *Highway signs help us get from point A to Green Bay* |\\n\\nAlso in support of routing use cases, we [added a `destinations` property](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/pull/176) to the segment feature type.\\nThis property describes the transitions from one segment to another on the way to a specified location.\\nIn turn-by-turn routing applications, this is what is known as \u201cfollow signs for\u201d &mdash; the human-readable\\ndirections and signposts along a road, highway, or interstate that get us from point A to point Z, by way\\nof any number of paths in between. We designed `destinations` with a flexible schema that will allow us to\\ncapture and model navigation data from many different sources.\\n\\nHere\'s an example of how highway sign information in the picture above is modeled in the `destinations` schema:\\n\\n```yaml\\ndestinations:\\n  - when:\\n    heading: forward\\n    from_connector_id: 08f274370d59a8840436ff3bad31c60e\\n    to_connector_id: 08f274370d59a8840436ff3bad31c60e\\n    to_segment_id: 08a274370d59ffff043fff3b802d7aa5\\n    final_heading: forward\\n    labels:\\n     - value: Green Bay\\n      type: unknown\\n     - value: I 43 North\\n      type: route_ref\\n    symbols:\\n     - NULL\\n```\\n\\n## Transportation splitter tool\\nRecently we made our [transportation splitter tool](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/transportation-splitter)\\navailable in a public GitHub repository. The tool is an experimental PySpark script and Jupyter notebook that offers\\nmultiple ways to split Overture\u2019s transportation features into smaller and simpler segments. Our new transportation guide includes [several examples of how to use it](https://docs.overturemaps.org/guides/transportation/#transportation-splitter).

We\u2019ve punted on making cartographic decisions in favor of displaying all of Overture\u2019s themes, all at once: addresses, base, buildings, divisions, places, and transportation. Our users are coming at the data with different perspectives and goals, and we want to provide as much information as possible. We also want to stoke your curiosity and inspire you to ask new questions of Overture data. \\n\\nSeeing all the data all at once might be a bit overwhelming. We recommend zooming to an area of interest, hovering over the layers icon in the upper left corner of the map, and toggling the data themes off and on. You can click on an individual map feature, like the famous [\\"Lion Crushing a Serpent\\"](https://youtu.be/rTl2ewUc6bA?feature=shared) statue, to inspect its properties. Want to download the data? In the upper right corner of the Explore site, you can click on the Download Visible button to generate a GeoJSON file containing all the data visible in the browser. \\n\\nThe [Explore site](https://explore.overturemaps.org/#13.01/39.95692/-75.15583) is currently in beta, and your feedback will inform the features we add in the coming months. If you have questions about the data, or if you want to report a problem with data quality or a glitch in the website, please click on the bug icon and [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/io-site/issues). (Note: we are actively working on fixing known issues with the downloaded data.)\\n\\n## Build with us\\n\\nThis project grew out of the diverse experiences and skill sets of the engineers working on Overture. We\u2019re using [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) and Rust, specifically [geoarrow-rs](https://geoarrow.org/geoarrow-rs/), to query and download [Overture\u2019s GeoParquet files](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/). The front end is React and [Maplibre](https://maplibre.org/), and we\u2019re generating [PMTiles](https://docs.protomaps.com/pmtiles/) to visualize the data. It\u2019s a serverless site, using all cloud-native data storage formats. We also plan to make [PMTiles available with each Overture release](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overture-tiles). Special thanks to Kyle Barron from [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/) and Brandon Liu from [Protomaps](https://protomaps.com/) for collaborating with Overture\'s Developer Advocacy team on this project. \\n\\n[Explore is open source](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/io-site), under an MIT license, and we welcome contributions from the Overture community. Our goal is to give you the basic building blocks for creating your own tools around Overture data.

The transportation theme remains in beta, and users can anticipate additional breaking changes to the transportation schema. Also in this release, we launched a new theme called addresses, available in alpha. We will be making significant changes to the addresses schema and updating and adding to the addresses data over the next several months.\\n\\nThe datasets are available as GeoParquet files stored on AWS and Azure. The release paths are:\\n\\n#### Microsoft Azure:\\n```\\nwasbs://release@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2024-07-22.0\\n```\\n\\n#### Amazon S3:\\n```\\ns3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-07-22.0\\n```\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nYou can access the datasets by following the process outlined [here](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/). We encourage users to report bugs and provide feedback on the data, schema, and GERS on one of our Overture GitHub repositories:\\n\\n- [Schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema)\\n- [Data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data)\\n- [Docs](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/docs)\\n- [Python command-line tool](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py)\\n- [Explore site](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/io-site)\\n\\n## New theme: addresses\\n\\nIn this release, we added a new theme called [addresses](/schema/reference/addresses/address) that includes over 200 million address features for 14 countries. We are releasing this theme in alpha and anticipate significant changes over the next several releases. We invite the Overture community to test the addresses schema and data and offer feedback via the [data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/issues) and [schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/issues) repos.\\n\\n\\n## Breaking changes\\n\\nIn the divisions theme, we changed the `boundary` feature type to `division_boundary`. Feature types in Overture must be distinct and unique across all themes, and `boundary` did not meet those conditions. We realize that changing the name of a feature type is a major change, and we do not anticipate doing this again without giving our users plenty of advance notice. \\n\\nAlso in the divisions theme, we changed the `divisions` property to `divisions_ids` to fix relationship modeling in the schema. The logic is that a property or nested sub-property that contains a foreign key reference to another feature by Overture ID must end in the suffix `_id`. More information about this change here: https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/pull/215\\n\\nWe removed `update_time` from a top-level schema property to a property within the sources structure. For example, the Microsoft buildings `update_time` comes from Microsoft\'s imagery capture data:\\n```\\n[{property=, dataset=Microsoft ML Buildings, record_id=709fc8cf0b55, update_time=2023-06-23T00:00:00.000Z, confidence=null}]\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Deprecations\\n\\nIn the transportation theme, we deprecated the `road` JSON column in the June release and removed it in the current release. We replaced the `road` JSON column with structured Parquet columns for road attributes.\\n\\nIn April, we deprecated the admins theme and offered the divisions theme as a replacement. We removed admins in this release and are no longer supporting it. You can still access the admins data and schema in previous Overture releases.\\n\\n\\n## Theme-specific updates\\n\\n:::info\\nThe base, buildings, divisions, and places themes are now in the General Availability (GA) phase.

This hotfix addressed the following regressions:\\n- in the transportation theme, a bug in one of our automated processes inadvertently caused the conversion of unicode characters to ASCII. This affected roughly 10% of `segment` features that contained characters outside of the ASCII range, primarily names but possibly things like speed limit/weight restrictions if those properties contained values with characters outside that range.\\n- in the buildings theme, the `roof_height` property was not fully populated; the hotfix adds 143k `roof_height` values to the release. \\n\\nThe new release paths are:\\n```\\nAzure path: wasbs://release@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2024-06-13-beta.1\\n\\nAWS path: s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-06-13-beta.1\\n```\\n:::\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n\\nOverture\'s `2024-06-13-beta.0` release is available in GeoParquet and stored on AWS and Azure.

It\'s similar to the land cover layer in the [Daylight](https://daylightmap.org/2023/10/11/landcover.html) map distribution, but Overture Maps added higher-resolution data (zoom level 15) with more detail and land cover classes. You\'ll find 10 subtypes in the new data: snow, forest, urban, grass, crop, barren, wetland, moss, mangrove, and shrub. \\n\\nOur May release also includes [schema properties](https://docs.overturemaps.org/schema/reference/base/land_cover/) that offer cartographic \\"hints\\" for optimal use of Overture Maps data in mapmaking. We added `min_zoom` and `max_zoom` to define the recommended zooms for each resolution of land cover, using the common \u201cslippy maps\u201d zoom level specification. This is a first step toward improving the user experience for mapmakers.

This allows for more detail in a feature. Parking garages, for example, now have the attributes: `subtype=transportation` and `class=parking`.\\n\\n\\n### Deprecations\\nLast month, we announced the deprecation of our `admins` theme and launched its replacement, `divisions`. Because of issues with missing data in `divisions`, we have extended the life of `admins`. Here is the new deprecation schedule: the two themes will coexist in the May, June, and July 2024 releases; in the August 2024 release, we will fully remove `admins` from our schema and data. More information on why we made this change [here](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/discussions/117).\\n\\n### Schema Changelog\\nSee our [changelog](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/releases) here.\\n\\n### Theme-specific updates\\n\\n**Divisions/Admins**\\n\\n- refreshed data with OpenStreetMap snap on 10 May 2024\\n- populated `region` field for `division_area` type\\n- populated `local_type` field `division` type\\n- known issue: the `capital_division_id` field in `division` type is missing data\\n\\n:::warning\\nSee information above about the deprecation of `admins` schema and data\\n:::\\n\\n**Base**\\n\\n- added `land_cover` schema and data derived from ESA WorldCover high-resolution Earth observation imagery\\n- added new subtypes in `infrastructure` type: `barrier`, `pedestrian`, `utility`, `waste_management`, `water`\\n- added `min_zoom` and `max_zoom` attributes for cartographic purposes\\n\\n**Buildings**\\n\\n- promoted `class` to `subtype` and introduced new class values for buildings. Where relevant, the class tag is the value of the building key in OSM. This allows anyone to use previous class types as subtype (backwards compatible) and introduces new class values that allow for more detail, like parking. Parking garages, for example, now have the attributes: `subtype=transportation`, `class=parking`; example of new subtypes, promoted from class: `agricultural`, `civic`, `commercial`, `education`, `entertainment`, `industrial`, `medical`, `military`, `outbuilding`, `religious`, `residential`, `service`, `transportation`\\n- made incremental updates from OSM since the previous release\\n\\n**Places**\\n\\n- made incremental changes to improve the accuracy and quality of the dataset\\n\\n**Transportation**\\n\\n- added missing vehicle travel mode\\n- added missing `is_covered` road flag\\n- populated `is_abandoned` flag when relevant abandoned or disused tags are present\\n- added OSM source ids for connectors\\n- fixed null linear referencing for names in some cases\\n\\n### Attribution\\n\\nYou\'ll find information about attribution and licensing [here](https://docs.overturemaps.org/attribution/)."},{"id":"/2024/04/22/beta-release","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/04/22/beta-release","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-22-beta-release.mdx","title":"Exploring our beta release","description":"Highlights from Overture Maps beta release","date":"2024-04-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"releases","permalink":"/blog/tags/releases"},{"inline":true,"label":"developer-tools","permalink":"/blog/tags/developer-tools"},{"inline":true,"label":"geoparquet","permalink":"/blog/tags/geoparquet"}],"readingTime":2.98,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"title":"Exploring our beta release","description":"Highlights from Overture Maps beta release","tags":["releases","developer-tools","geoparquet"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"2024-05-16-beta.0","permalink":"/blog/2024-05-16-beta.0"},"nextItem":{"title":"Welcome to the Overture Maps engineering blog!","permalink":"/blog/2024/04/21/welcome"}},"content":"import Tabs from \'@theme/Tabs\';\\nimport TabItem from \'@theme/TabItem\';\\n\\nLast week Overture Maps [announced the beta release](https://overturemaps.org/overture-maps-foundation-releases-beta-of-its-first-open-map-dataset/) of our schema and data.

We made this possible by working closely with open-source collaborators on the repartitioning and [spatial optimization](https://cloudnativegeo.org/blog/2024/03/coming-soon-geoparquet-1.1/) of our GeoParquet files. Meanwhile, our friends at DuckDB, one of our favorite SQL tools, [added a feature](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/10314) that improves the performance of queries with bounding boxes.\\n\\n<details>\\n\\n<summary>Query speeds have improved significantly from our February release to the April beta release.

Along with the folks at Development Seed, an [Overture Maps Foundation member](https://overturemaps.org/about/members/), we\'re [building special tools for Overture Maps data on top of lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/examples/overture-maps/), their Python library for visualizing large geospatial datasets in Jupyter. And recently our friends at Wherobots [took a comprehensive look](https://wherobots.com/overture-maps-data-cloud-native-geoparquet-apache-sedona/) at how our use of GeoParquet makes querying and analyzing our data with Apache Sedona very efficient. \\n\\nAs you can see, we\'re moving forward with the community to iterate on data, software, and specifications with the shared goal of making geospatial **_fast_**.\\n\\n## Easier-to-use schema\\nAnother highlight of the beta release is the transition to an easier-to-use schema for our administrative boundary data. We first [explored this idea](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/discussions/117) with the Overture Maps community in February, and after two short months of work, the [new divisions schema and data](https://docs.overturemaps.org/guides/divisions/) are ready to go. Here\'s a query to `divisions` that grabs geometries for all the countries in the world:\\n\\n```\\nSELECT *\\n   FROM read_parquet(\'s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-04-16-beta.0/theme=divisions/type=division_area/*\', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)\\nWHERE subtype = \'country\';\\n```\\n \\n You can see that the `divisions` query above is much simpler than a comparable query to `admins`:\\n\\n\\n```\\nWITH admins AS (\\n    SELECT *\\n    FROM read_parquet(\'s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-04-16-beta.0/theme=admins/type=*/*\', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)\\n  )\\n\\n  SELECT *\\n    FROM admins country_locality\\n    JOIN admins country_area\\n      ON country_area.locality_id = country_locality.id\\n   WHERE country_locality.locality_type = \'country\';\\n\\n```    \\n\\nWe plan to [deprecate admins](https://docs.overturemaps.org/release-notes/) by the July release. In the meantime, both `admins` and `divisions` will be available to users. \\n\\n## Bridges, islands, waterfalls, and more!\\nWe added more rich detail to our `base` layer in this release, including an `infrastructure` type with familiar features from [Facebook\u2019s Daylight map distribution](https://daylightmap.org/). We also added new subtypes and classes for the `land`, `land_use`, and `water` feature types. You\'ll find a comprehensive listing of the subtypes and classes for each feature type in our [schema reference docs](https://docs.overturemaps.org/schema/reference/base/infrastructure). Ready to make your own map? We have a [tutorial to help you get started](https://docs.overturemaps.org/examples/build-a-map/#13/47.6/-122.33/0/45).\\n  \\n## Stay tuned for more highlights\\nWe\'ll be back soon with more posts that explore our path from the beta release to production. In the meantime, we invite you to [get started with our data](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/) and share with us your [comments and feedback](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/discussions)."},{"id":"/2024/04/21/welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/04/21/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-21-welcome.mdx","title":"Welcome to the Overture Maps engineering blog!","description":"Welcome to the Overture Maps engineering blog!

That same query to find Pennsylvania now looks like this:\\n\\n```sql\\nLOAD spatial;\\nLOAD httpfs:\\n\\nSELECT\\n   id,\\n   iso_sub_country_code,\\n   context_id,\\n   names.primary,\\n   ST_GeomFromWKB(geometry) as geometry\\nFROM\\n   read_parquet(\'s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-03-12-alpha.0/theme=admins/type=*/*\', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)\\nWHERE type=\'locality\'\\n   AND subtype=\'administrative_locality\'\\n   AND admin_level=2\\n   AND names.primary LIKE \'Pennsylvania\';\\n```\\n```\\n\u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\\n\u2502                id                \u2502 iso_sub_country_code \u2502            context_id            \u2502   primary    \u2502            geometry            \u2502\\n\u2502             varchar              \u2502       varchar        \u2502             varchar              \u2502   varchar    \u2502            geometry            \u2502\\n\u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2524\\n\u2502 0857b2b73fffffff01914c596abbfacd \u2502 US-PA                \u2502 0850c861bfffffff01aeb407d56d3441 \u2502 Pennsylvania \u2502 POINT (-77.7278831 40.9699889) \u2502\\n\u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2534\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Deprecations\\nIn the April 2024 release, Overture will implement a refactor of the `Admins` theme called `Divisions`.

The overall purpose of this new theme is to allow users to create a complete map using any Overture release. Descriptions of the subTypes for Base are:\\n- land: Physical representations of land surfaces. Derived from the inverse of OSM Coastlines.\\n- landUse: Classifications of the human use of a section of land. Mostly derived from the key landuse in OpenStreetMap\\n- water: Physical representations of inland and ocean marine surfaces. Derived from OSM Coastlines, and the keys natural and waterway in OpenStreetMap.\\n\\nAll of the features in the base theme are from OpenStreetMap, sourced via the Daylight Map Distribution. Original OSM tags remain on all features. Some tags become top-level properties, such as the surface or wikidata tags.\\n\\nData in the Base theme is licensed under ODbL.\\n\\n**Buildings Theme**\\nThe dataset includes 1.39B conflated building footprints from OSM, Esri Community Maps, and Microsoft ML Building Footprints. This is an increase of ~700M building footprints from the July Alpha release by including the complete Microsoft ML Building footprint dataset.\\n\\nThe order of conflation is OpenStreetMap > Esri Community Maps > Microsoft ML Building Footprints. For example, if Esri has a building that does not exist in OSM, we take that building, then, we \\"fill-in\\" the rest of the map with any Microsoft ML buildings that do not intersect with either OSM or Esri.\\n\\n:::note\\nA sample set of 1.6M buildings from OpenStreetMap and Esri have been assigned an initial GERS ID for demonstration purposes. These IDs are 32 character strings. By referencing these other datasets to this data release, we can match GERS IDs to external datasets and demonstrate how GERS can enable ID-based joins between two geospatial datasets. These are located in the following cities:\\n- United States: Seattle, Washington; Macon, Georgia; Charleston, South Carolina; Spokane, Washington\\n- Canada: Kingston, Ontario\\n- Netherlands: Leeuwarden, Friesland\\n- Germany: Berlin\\n- Brazil: Rio De Janeiro\\n\\nFor a deeper look at how GERS is used to link datasets on this data, see [this blog post from Deane Kensok at Esri](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/mapping/enriching-overture-data-with-gers/).\\n:::\\n\\nThe sources include OpenStreetMap, Microsoft Building footprints, and Esri Community Partners. Some building heights have also been derived using lidar from USGS 3DEP. The Building data is in the Overture Maps data schema for Buildings.\\n\\nData in the Buildings theme is licensed under ODbL.\\n\\n**Administrative Boundaries (Admins) Theme**\\nThe Admins theme includes multiple locality types:\\n- Countries formed from OpenStreetMap relations, primarily admin_level=2, with few exceptions such as admin_level=3 French Polynesia.\\n- First-level subdivisions under the country which was mapped from OpenStreetMap admin_level depending on country, in most countries admin_level=4.\\n- Second-level subdivisions under the country which was mapped from OpenStreetMap admin_level depending on country, in most countries admin_level=6.\\n- Cities, Town, Villages, Neighborhoods... based on place=* tag. In most cases these are just points. When relation with place=* tag exist we provide polygon geometry.\\n\\nIt also includes administrative boundaries representing borders of countries, first-level subdivisions and second-level subdivisions. The Administrative Boundary data is in the Overture Maps data schema for Admin.\\nSecond-level subdivision did not undergo worldwide inspection of quality so some missing or wrong data is expected. All first-level subdivisions have `type=state` and all second-level subdivisions have `type=county` which is not always true; we plan to address this issue in future releases. We plan to use admin_level=8,9,10 to add polygons to cities, town, villages and other localities when available depending on individual country mapping.\\n\\nData in the Admin theme is licensed under ODbL. The sources of the admin theme are OpenStreetMap and Esri.\\n\\n**Places Theme**\\nThis release has over 57M place records. The Places theme in this release includes several modifications to improve the accuracy and quality of the dataset:\\n- Increased deduplication on significant landmarks by revising the screening criteria for signals based on check-ins only\\n- Removal of places determined to be non-existent\\n- Address normalization bug fix that was yielding incorrect pin locations. In addition, support for website, phone and category was added to the Microsoft sourced data.\\n- Some additional place records were added as a result of tuning of the algorithms.\\n\\nData in the Places theme is licensed under CDLA Permissive 2.0.\\n\\n**Transportation Theme**\\nThe Transportation theme includes the following improvements:\\n- Collective OSM changes through September 15th, updated and converted to Overture\'s Schema.\\n- Addition of Linear Referenced features, enabling the description of properties that apply along only portions of a segment.\\n- Over 1.3 million turn restrictions worldwide\\n- Additional scoping types populated in the Transportation data, including Travel Modes, Temporal Scoping, Geometric Scoping, and Heading\\n- Additional properties populated in the Transportation data, including Speed Limits, surface, and road flags.\\n\\n:::note\\nThere are several missing properties in this data release that will be added in future releases:\\n- Only includes road segments made from Ways that include a \u2018highway\u2019 tag\\n- Non-geometric scoping properties are not included\\n- Turn and Access restrictions are not included\\n- Lane information is not included\\n- Some language/scripts are not included in names properties\\n:::\\n\\n:::note\\nThe data includes some provisional Global Entity Reference System (GERS) data which is used to express relationships between road segments.

The Building data is in the Overture Maps data schema for Buildings.\\n\\nData in the Buildings theme is licensed under ODbL.\\n\\n**Transportation Theme**\\nThe transportation theme includes road networks data based on OpenStreetMap.  This release is a demonstration of our Shape and Connectivity model of the transportation network, and also showcases how Geometric Scoping (LR) interacts with a subset of the final properties. The data has been put into the Overture Maps data schema for transportation.  As such, the data has been re-segmented and structured with some conditional attributes. For example, scoping dimensions related to speed limits have geometric scoping when speed limits change along a road segment.\\n\\n:::note\\nThe data includes some provisional Global Entity Reference System (GERS) data which is used to express relationships between road segments.
