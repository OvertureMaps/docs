After months of hard work and steady improvements, we are nearing production-level stability. In a series of posts over the next few weeks -- starting with this one -- we\u2019ll unpack the highlights and improvements you\'ll see in this release and beyond. \\n\\n## Making geospatial fast\\nThe first thing you\'ll notice is how much faster you can [pull Overture Maps data for your area of interest out of the cloud](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/locally/). We made this possible by working closely with open-source collaborators on the repartitioning and [spatial optimization](https://cloudnativegeo.org/blog/2024/03/coming-soon-geoparquet-1.1/) of our GeoParquet files. We also partnered with DuckDB to [improve the way their tooling](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/pull/10314) interacts with our data. \\n\\n<details>\\n\\n<summary>Query speeds have improved significantly from our February release to the April beta release. This example compares DuckDB queries for buildings in Philadelphia. [See here for more information about our performance testing](https://github.com/opengeospatial/geoparquet/discussions/188#discussioncomment-8909348).</summary>\\n\\n    <Tabs>\\n        <TabItem value=\\"february\\" label=\\"2024-02-15-alpha.0 release\\" default>\\n            ```\\n            SELECT \\n            *\\n            FROM \\n                read_parquet(\'s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-02-15-alpha.0/theme=buildings/type=building/*\', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)\\n            WHERE \\n                bbox.minx > -75.60154\\n                AND bbox.maxx < -74.955763\\n                AND bbox.miny > 39.867004\\n                AND bbox.maxy < 40.137992;\\n            ```\\n            820,915 buildings   \\n            ~120s\\n        </TabItem>\\n\\n    \\n        <TabItem value=\\"april\\" label=\\"2024-04-16-beta.0 release\\" default>\\n            ```\\n            SELECT \\n            *\\n            FROM   \\n                read_parquet(\'s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-04-16-beta.0/theme=buildings/type=building/*\', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)\\n            WHERE \\n                bbox.xmin > -75.60154\\n                AND bbox.xmax < -74.955763\\n                AND bbox.ymin > 39.867004\\n                AND bbox.ymax < 40.137992\\n            ```\\n            852,487 buildings    \\n            ~25s\\n        </TabItem>\\n    </Tabs>\\n</details>\\n\\nWe\'re still working to makes things faster and easier. Along with the folks at Development Seed, an [Overture Maps Foundation member](https://overturemaps.org/about/members/), we\'re [building special tools for Overture Maps data on top of lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/examples/overture-maps/), their Python library for visualizing large geospatial datasets in Jupyter. And recently our friends at Wherobots [took a comprehensive look](https://wherobots.com/overture-maps-data-cloud-native-geoparquet-apache-sedona/) at how our use of GeoParquet makes querying and analyzing our data with Apache Sedona very efficient. \\n\\nAs you can see, we\'re moving forward with the community to iterate on data, software, and specifications with the shared goal of making geospatial **_fast_**.\\n\\n## Easier-to-use schema\\nAnother highlight of the beta release is the transition to an easier-to-use schema for our administrative boundary data. We first [explored this idea](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/discussions/117) with the Overture Maps community in February, and after two short months of work, the [new divisions schema and data](https://docs.overturemaps.org/guides/divisions/) are ready to go. Here\'s a query to `divisions` that grabs geometries for all the countries in the world:\\n\\n```\\nSELECT *\\n   FROM read_parquet(\'s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-04-16-beta.0/theme=divisions/type=division_area/*\', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)\\nWHERE subtype = \'country\';\\n```\\n \\n You can see that the `divisions` query above is much simpler than a comparable query to `admins`:\\n\\n\\n```\\nWITH admins AS (\\n    SELECT *\\n    FROM read_parquet(\'s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-04-16-beta.0/theme=admins/type=*/*\', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)\\n  )\\n\\n  SELECT *\\n    FROM admins country_locality\\n    JOIN admins country_area\\n      ON country_area.locality_id = country_locality.id\\n   WHERE country_locality.locality_type = \'country\';\\n\\n```    \\n\\nWe plan to [deprecate admins](https://docs.overturemaps.org/release-notes/) by the July release. In the meantime, both `admins` and `divisions` will be available to users. \\n\\n## Bridges, islands, waterfalls, and more!\\nWe added more rich detail to our `base` layer in this release, including an `infrastructure` type with familiar features from [Facebook\u2019s Daylight map distribution](https://daylightmap.org/). We also added new subtypes and classes for the `land`, `land_use`, and `water` feature types. We listed a few of the new features below, with icons from the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) just for fun. You\'ll find a comprehensive listing of the subtypes and classes for each feature type in our [schema reference docs](https://docs.overturemaps.org/schema/reference/base/infrastructure). Ready to make your own map? We have a [tutorial to help you get started](https://docs.overturemaps.org/examples/build-a-map/#13/47.6/-122.33/0/45).\\n\\n| `infrastructure`| |\\n| ----- | ----- |\\n| `bridge` | ![bridge](/img/blog/bridges.png) |\\n| `power_line` | ![power lines](/img/blog/power-lines.png) |\\n| `aerialway` | ![cable car](/img/blog/cable-car.png) |\\n\\n| `land`|          |\\n| ----- | ----- |\\n| `desert` | ![desert](/img/blog/desert.png) |\\n| `mountain_range` | ![mountain range](/img/blog/mountain-range.png) |\\n| `plateau` | ![plateau](/img/blog/plateau.png) |\\n\\n\\n| `land_use`|      |\\n| ----- | ----- |\\n| `beach_resort`| ![beach resort](/img/blog/beach-resort.png) |\\n| `graveyard` | ![graveyard](/img/blog/graveyard.png) |\\n\\n\\n| `water`|        |\\n| ----- | ----- |\\n| `blowhole` | ![blowhole](/img/blog/blowhole.png) |\\n| `waterfall` | ![waterfall](/img/blog/waterfall.png) |\\n\\n \\n## Stay tuned for more highlights\\nWe\'ll be back next week with more posts that explore our path from the beta release to production.
