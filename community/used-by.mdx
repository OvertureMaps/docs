# Overture Deployed

These companies and organizations are using Overture data in production. 

### [Shadowmap](https://shadowmap.org/)
Shadowmap is an interactive platform for visualizing and analyzing light at any location time, and date. In summer 2024, they started using Overture bulidings for global coverage and more accurate heights. 

"That's why we're super stoked about Overture – a service that greatly improves the way we can work with open map data in Shadowmap by connecting many different data sources."


### [Aire Labs](https://www.airelabs.com/)
Aire Labs is a start-up with a mission to help climate positive technologies deploy faster. One of the customers is working on carbon removal in rivers, so they've been using Overture and OpenStreetMap geometries to augment the very coarse HydroRIVERS geometries. They've also been using Overture buildings as a proxy for population density.  

"I previously used OSM directly, but I live in geoparquet, so Overture has been a breath of fresh air." - senior data engineer, Aire Labs
