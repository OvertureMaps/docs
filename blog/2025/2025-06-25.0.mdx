## Overview

**The `2025-06-25.0` release of Overture data and `v1.10.0` of the Overture schema are now available.** We're pleased to annouce that GERS is now in GA! This means we've launched and updated several componenets of the "system" to make it production-ready. 

The datasets are available as GeoParquet files stored on both AWS and Azure. The release paths are:

#### Microsoft Azure:
```
wasbs://release@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2025-06-25.0
```

#### Amazon S3:
```
s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2025-06-25.0
```

You can access the datasets by following the process outlined [here](/getting-data). We encourage you to ask questions and provide feedback on the Overture Maps [Discussion forum on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/OvertureMaps/discussions). You can also file issues and report bugs in our [data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/issues) and [schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/issues) repositories. If you have a suggestion for a new dataset or if you have data you'd like to contribute to Overture, you can email us at data@overturemaps.org. Weâ€™d love to hear from you.

## What's new? Big changes to GERS. 

In this release, Overture has standardized the [`id` property](/schema/#top-level-properties) across all themes by adopting [UUIDs](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9562.html), stored as strings. This is a **one-time** breaking change for our ID system. For this release only, we are offering Parquet files, partioned by `theme` and `type` that map the old May IDs to the new June UUIDs.  You can find that file here: `s3://overturemaps-extras-us-west-2/june_to_may_id_mapping/`.

Overture is now producing bridge files with each release. You can find the latest bridge files here, partitioned by `dataset`, `theme`, and `type`:

```
wasbs://bridgefiles@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2025-06-25.0
```
```
s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/bridgefiles/2025-06-25.0
```

The newest component of GERS is the GERS Registry, which will also be updated with each release. The GERS Registry files are here:

```
wasbs://registry@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2025-06-25.0
```
```
s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/registry/2025-06-25.0
```

## Breaking changes

- added `perspectives` to the top-level `names` property

- added rails to transportation
- ensured no array is empty on places properties
- migrated GERS IDs to new GERS UUIDs 

## Theme-specific updates

:::info
The base, buildings, divisions, places, and transportation themes are in GA. The addresses theme is in alpha. All themes have 100% ID churn this release because of the switch to UUIDs.
:::

### Base

- addded all upstream source tages from OSM to the `source_tags` property

### Buildings

### Transportation

- added new TomTom-sourced segments, improving coverage in Turkey
