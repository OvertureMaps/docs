:::warning

Recently Overture implemented a data retention policy for our releases. Overture data will be publicly available on AWS and Azure for a maximum of 60 days, approximately two monthly releases. After that, we will automatically remove data files from public distribution using cloud storage lifecycle policies. You can find more information about Overture's data retention policy on the [releases](https://docs.overturemaps.org/release-calendar/#data-retention-policy) page in this documentation.

## Overview

**The `2025-10-22.0` release of Overture data and `v1.13.0` of the Overture schema are now available.** The datasets and release artifacts are available as GeoParquet files stored on both AWS and Azure. There are several data updates and (minor) breaking schema changes in this release. 

## What's new?

### New `basic_category` property in the places schema

In the places schema this month, we introduced a simple `basic_category` property that maps to our original `categories.primary` property. This change is part of an ongoing initiative to reimagine Overture's places category taxomony. The creation of a `basic_category` property is based on a commonly-used cognitive science concept called "basic-level categories." The idea is to find a balance between being specific enough to be useful while general enough to be broadly applicable.
