:::warning
With the September release, Overture is implementing a data retention policy for publicly-available data releases.

#### What's changing:
- Data releases will be publicly available for a maximum of 60 days (approximately two monthly releases)
- Data files will be automatically removed from public distribution after this period using cloud storage lifecycle policies

#### What remains available:
- The most recent two monthly data releases (last 60 days)
- Versioned changelogs and bridgefiles for all releases
- GERS registry
- Release notes from all past releases

#### Why we're implementing this:
This policy ensures compliance with data protection regulations, including GDPR "right to be forgotten" requirements.

You can find complete details about our release schedule and policies on the [releases](https://docs.overturemaps.org/release-calendar/) page in the Overture documentation. Questions? Comments? Please contribute to [this thread on our GitHub Discussions forum](https://github.com/orgs/OvertureMaps/discussions/422) or reach out to us at info@overturemaps.org.
