title: Land cover is live
---

## Mapmakers rejoice! 

The [May release](https://docs.overturemaps.org/release/latest) of Overture Maps includes high-resolution land cover data *and* cartographic schema properties.

Our new `land_cover` layer is vectorized data derived from the [European Space Agency’s 2020 WorldCover (10m) rasters](https://esa-worldcover.org/en). It's similar to the land cover data in the [Daylight](https://daylightmap.org/2023/10/11/landcover.html) map distribution, but Overture Maps is including a high-resolution version (zoom level 15) with more detail and land cover classes. 

You'll find 10 subtypes in our `land_cover` type: snow, forest, urban, grass, crop, barren, wetland, moss, mangrove, and shrub. We also offer lower-resolution data with seven subtypes: snow, forest, urban, grass, crop, barren, and shrub. 

Our May release also includes new schema properties that offer cartographic "hints" for optimal use of Overture Maps data in mapmaking. We added `min_zoom` and `max_zoom` to define the recommended zooms for each resolution of land cover, using the common “slippy maps” zoom level specification. This is a first step toward improving the user experience for mapmakers. We plan to expand these properties in future releases of Overture Maps data.

## Exploring land cover

In the example below, we'll show you how to use [lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/) and the Overture Maps Python command-line tool to extract, process, and visualize land cover data for an area of interest. We recommend that you consult [the Overture Maps buildings example](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/examples/overture-maps/ ) in the lonboard docs to better understand the methods used here.

You'll need to [install lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/#install) and [overturemaps-py](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py) before you get started. 

```
#pip install overturemaps
pip install -e . #clone repo and install pre-release version in directory
```

``` python
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd
import overturemaps #dev branch, pre-release 
from shapely import wkb
from lonboard import Map, PolygonLayer
from lonboard.colormap import apply_categorical_cmap
```

``` python
# specify bounding box
bbox =  -78.6429, 39.463, -73.7806, 41.6242
```

``` python
# read in Overture Maps land_cover data type
table = overturemaps.record_batch_reader("land_cover", bbox).read_all()
table = table.combine_chunks()
```

``` python
# convert to dataframe
df = table.to_pandas()
```

``` python
# filter for higher resolution land_cover features
df_h = df[df.cartography.apply(lambda x: x['min_zoom'] == 8)]
```

``` python
# create color map for land_cover subtypes, loosely based on natural-color palette: https://www.shadedrelief.com/shelton/c.html
color_map = {
    "urban": [167, 162, 186],
    "forest": [134, 178, 137],
    "barren": [245, 237, 213],
    "shrub": [239, 218, 182],
    "grass": [254, 239, 173],
    "crop": [222, 223, 154],
    "wetland": [158, 207, 195], 
    "mangrove": [83, 171, 128],
    "moss": [250, 230, 160],
    "snow": [255, 255, 255],
    #"none": [108, 159, 184],   
}
```

``` python
# apply color map to land_cover subtypes
colors = apply_categorical_cmap(df_h.subtype, color_map)
```

``` python
# dataframe to geodataframe, set crs
gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(
    df_h, 
    geometry=df_h['geometry'].apply(wkb.loads), 
    crs="EPSG:4326"
)
```

``` python
# reproject to Pennsylvania State Plane (https://epsg.io/2272) 
# gdf = gdf.to_crs(2272)
```

``` python
# create map layer 
layer = PolygonLayer.from_geopandas(
    gdf= gdf[['id','subtype', 'cartography', 'geometry']].reset_index(drop=True),
    get_fill_color=colors,
    get_line_color=colors,
)
```

``` python
#render map
view_state = {
    "longitude": -76.2,
    "latitude": 39.6,
    "zoom": 8,
    "pitch": 65,
    "bearing": 5,
}
m = Map(layer, view_state=view_state)
m
```
