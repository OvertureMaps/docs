## Mapmakers rejoice!

The [May release](https://docs.overturemaps.org/release/latest) of Overture Maps includes new high-resolution land cover data _and_ new cartographic schema properties.

<!-- truncate -->

Our `land_cover` layer is vectorized data derived from the [European Space Agency’s 2020 WorldCover (10m) rasters](https://esa-worldcover.org/en). It's similar to the land cover layer in the [Daylight](https://daylightmap.org/2023/10/11/landcover.html) map distribution, but Overture Maps added higher-resolution data (zoom level 15) with more detail and land cover classes. You'll find 10 subtypes in the new data: snow, forest, urban, grass, crop, barren, wetland, moss, mangrove, and shrub.

Our May release also includes [schema properties](https://docs.overturemaps.org/schema/reference/base/land_cover/) that offer cartographic "hints" for optimal use of Overture Maps data in mapmaking. We added `min_zoom` and `max_zoom` to define the recommended zooms for each resolution of land cover, using the common “slippy maps” zoom level specification. This is a first step toward improving the user experience for mapmakers. We plan to expand these properties in future releases of Overture Maps data.

## Exploring land cover

In the notebook example below, we'll show you how to extract, process, and visualize land cover data for an area of interest using [lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/) and the [Overture Maps Python command-line tool](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py). We recommend that you consult [this example](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/examples/overture-maps/) in the lonboard docs to better understand the methods used here. You can view and download the complete notebook on [Notebook Sharing Space](https://notebooksharing.space/view/b63f6b3dda1da99c45caf53284fbc508aaae0a43480b43bb0316db636c5e6677).

To follow along, you'll need to have [JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) running and the following dependencies installed:

- [lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/#install)
- [overturemaps-py](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/index.html)
- [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)

```python
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd
import overturemaps
from shapely import wkb
from lonboard import Map, PolygonLayer
from lonboard.colormap import apply_categorical_cmap
```

```python
# specify bounding box
bbox =  -78.6429, 39.463, -73.7806, 41.6242
```

```python
# read in Overture Maps land_cover data type
table = overturemaps.record_batch_reader("land_cover", bbox).read_all()
table = table.combine_chunks()
```

```python
# convert to dataframe
df = table.to_pandas()
```

```python
# filter for higher resolution land_cover features
df_h = df[df.cartography.apply(lambda x: x['min_zoom'] == 8)]
```

```python
# create color map for land_cover subtypes, loosely based on natural-color palette: https://www.shadedrelief.com/shelton/c.html
color_map = {
    "urban": [167, 162, 186],
    "forest": [134, 178, 137],
    "barren": [245, 237, 213],
    "shrub": [239, 218, 182],
    "grass": [254, 239, 173],
    "crop": [222, 223, 154],
    "wetland": [158, 207, 195],
    "mangrove": [83, 171, 128],
    "moss": [250, 230, 160],
    "snow": [255, 255, 255],
}
```

```python
# apply color map to land_cover subtypes
colors = apply_categorical_cmap(df_h.subtype, color_map)
```

```python
# dataframe to geodataframe, set crs
gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(
    df_h,
    geometry=df_h['geometry'].apply(wkb.loads),
    crs="EPSG:4326"
)
```

```python
# create map layer
layer = PolygonLayer.from_geopandas(
    gdf= gdf[['id','subtype', 'cartography', 'geometry']].reset_index(drop=True),
    get_fill_color=colors,
    get_line_color=colors,
)
```

```python
#render map
view_state = {
    "longitude": -76.2,
    "latitude": 39.6,
    "zoom": 8,
    "pitch": 65,
    "bearing": 5,
}
m = Map(layer, view_state=view_state)
m
```
