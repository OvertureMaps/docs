## Overview

**The `2024-10-23.0` release of Overture data and `v1.2.0` of the Overture schema are now available.** As part of Overture's mission to improve data quality and coverage and to expand the number of sources we use to make our datasets, 
we added in this release address data for several new countries, transportation data in Saudi Arabia and Italy from TomTom, and building height data from Microsoft and Esri Community Maps contributors. 

The October release is available as GeoParquet files stored on both AWS and Azure. The release paths are:

#### Microsoft Azure:
```
wasbs://release@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2024-10-23.0
```

#### Amazon S3:
```
s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-10-23.0
```

:::note
We are now releasing Overture's GeoParquet files in accordance with the [GeoParquet v1.1.0 specification](https://geoparquet.org/releases/v1.1.0/), with the covering metadata included.
:::

You can access the datasets by following the process outlined [here](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/). We encourage you to ask questions, report bugs, and provide feedback via our [data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data) and [schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema) repositories on GitHub. If you have a suggestion for a new dataset or if you have data you'd like to contribute to Overture, you can email us at **data AT overturemaps.org**. We’d love to hear from you.


## Breaking changes

We removed the `connector_ids` property from the schema and replaced it with a new `connectors` property. You'll find more information about this change [here](https://docs.overturemaps.org/blog/2024/08/15/preview-august-release/#connectors).

## Deprecations

In the `2024-08-20.0` [release notes](https://docs.overturemaps.org/release/2024-08-20.0/), we announced the deprecation of the `connector_ids` property in the transportation schema. We have removed that property in this release.
