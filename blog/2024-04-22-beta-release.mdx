title: Exploring our beta release
description: Highlights from Overture Maps beta release
---

Last week Overture Maps [announced the beta release](https://overturemaps.org/overture-maps-foundation-releases-beta-of-its-first-open-map-dataset/) of our schema and data. After months of hard work and steady improvements, we are nearing production-level stability. In a series of posts over the next few weeks, we’ll unpack the highlights and improvements you'll see in this release and beyond. 

## Faster and easier to use
The first thing you'll notice is how much faster you can [move Overture Maps data out of the cloud and into your system](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/locally/). We made this possible through the repartitioning and spatial optimization of our GeoParquet files and by working closely with partner companies to improve the developer tools that play nicely with our data. We’ll cover the details of this work in a future blog post. 

Another highlight of the beta release is the transition to an easier-to-use schema for our administrative boundary data. We first [explored this idea](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/discussions/117) with the Overture Maps community in February, and after two short months of work, the [new divisions schema and data](https://docs.overturemaps.org/guides/divisions/) are ready to go. We also announced our plan to [deprecate admins](https://docs.overturemaps.org/release-notes/), the original schema, by the July release. In the meantime, both `admins` and `divisions` will be available to users. We'll outline use cases for our administrative boundary data in an upcoming post. 

## Bridges, islands, graveyards, and more!
We added more rich detail to our `base` layer in this release, including an `infrastructure` type that adds familiar features from [Facebook’s Daylight map distribution](https://daylightmap.org/): `bridges`, `power_lines`, `aerialways`, and more. We also added new classes for the `land` feature type, including `desert`, `island`, `mountain_range`, `plateau`, and more. To our `land_use` feature type we added `beach_resort`, `graveyard`, `pedestrian`, and `plaza` classes. Our `water` feature type now includes `bay`, `blowhole`, `geyser`, `hot_spring`, and `waterfall` classes. Ready to make your own map? We have a [tutorial to help you get started](https://docs.overturemaps.org/examples/build-a-map/#13/47.6/-122.33/0/45). 

## Stay tuned for more highlights
We'll be back next week with more posts that dig into the details of our beta release. In the meantime, we invite you to [get started with our data](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/) and share with us your [comments and feedback](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/discussions).
