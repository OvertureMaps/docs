## Overview

**The `2025-12-17.0` release of Overture data and `v1.15.0` of the Overture schema are now available.** The datasets and release artifacts are available as GeoParquet files stored on both AWS and Azure. 

## What's new?

We added a new `taxonomy` property to our places schema this month, as part of our ongoing initiative to redesign the places category system. The new property offers a streamlined and logical structure with consolidated primary and alternate names and a hierarchy that makes clear the parent/child relationship between categories. 

In October, we introduced the `basic_category` property. That property corresponds 1:1 to the primary place name in the new `taxonomy` property. (It also maps to the primary name in the original `categories` property.) The hierarchical paths in `taxonomy` support deeper and more logical structures. For example, in the restaurant branch, you can see a clear progression from very broad to very specific category names: `restaurant > asian_restaurant > east_asian_restaurant > chinese_restaurant > cantonese_restaurant`. This kind of structure makes it easier to aggregate and display POIs in meaningful ways.

The original `categories` property, with more than 2100 category names, will remain in the schema for the next several months so that users can compare the old system to the new taxonomy. 

Examples:

1. Original categories system 
```
properties:
   categories:
      primary: greasy_diner
```

2. `basic_category` mapped to primary category in original categories system 
```
properties:
   basic_category: casual_eatery
   categories:
      primary: gas_station_sushi
      alternate:
         - bait_and_tackle
```

3. New taxonomy
```
properties:
   basic_category: casual_eatery
   taxonomy: 
      hierarchy: [food_and_drink, restaurant, casual_eatery, gas_station_sushi]
      primary: gas_station_sushi
      alternate:
         - gas_station
         - sushi_restaurant
```
