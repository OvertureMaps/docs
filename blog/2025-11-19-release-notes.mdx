## Overview

**The `2025-11-19.0` release of Overture data and `v1.14.0` of the Overture schema are now available.** The datasets and release artifacts are available as GeoParquet files stored on both AWS and Azure. This is a [minor breaking change](/release-calendar) release. 

## What's new?

We added a `roller_coaster` class to our schema this month. Buckle up because next month we're adding rollercoaster data!
