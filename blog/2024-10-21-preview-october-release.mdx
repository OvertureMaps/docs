This week Overture is [releasing](https://docs.overturemaps.org/release/latest/) datasets that include new 
addresses across ten countries, new road features in Saudi Arabia and Italy from TomTom, 
and new building height data from Microsoft and Esri Community Maps contributors. Here's a preview of what you'll find in our October release.

## Addresses around the world
In July, Overture [launched](https://docs.overturemaps.org/release/2024-07-22.0/#new-theme-addresses) our addresses theme 
with 200 million features in 14 countries. Since then, 
we’ve added data for ten additional countries, bringing the total feature count to over 344 million. 
We’re building on great work by the open data community, including folks on the [OpenAddresses](https://openaddresses.io/)
and [AddressForAll](https://www.addressforall.org/en/) projects. 

And now we're excited to include another new source of open data for the U.S. Previously, Overture pulled all address data 
in the United States from the [Department of Transportation’s National 
Address Database (NAD)](https://www.transportation.gov/gis/national-address-database). 
Over the September and October releases, we developed a cut-and-replace workflow to swap NAD data in New York City 
with data from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). Local data FTW! This is a process 
we will continue to refine so that we can more 
easily fold in new data across all [Overture themes](https://docs.overturemaps.org/guides/).

## Roads and building heights
Also in the October release, you’ll find new data from [TomTom](https://www.tomtom.com/), representing more than 30,000 kilometers of roads in Saudi Arabia 
and Italy. We also added new building height data from both Microsoft and [Esri Community Maps contributors](https://communitymaps.arcgis.com/home/). 
These updates highlight Overture’s goal to improve data quality and coverage by incorporating new data into each release, 
with a focus on [data sources](https://docs.overturemaps.org/attribution/) that have permissive open-source licenses.

Please [reach out to us on GitHub](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/discussions) with questions and feedback about our data. 
If you have a suggestion for a new dataset or if you have data you'd like to contribute, you can email us at **data AT overturemaps.org**. We’d love to hear from you.
