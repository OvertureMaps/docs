title: What to expect in Overture’s October release
---

Later this week Overture will [release datasets](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/) that include new 
addresses across ten countries, new road features in Saudi Arabia and Italy from TomTom, 
and new building height data from Microsoft and Esri Community Maps contributors.

## Addresses around the world
In July, Overture [launched](https://docs.overturemaps.org/release/2024-07-22.0/#new-theme-addresses) its addresses theme 
with 200 million features in 14 countries. Since then, 
we’ve added data for ten additional countries, bringing the total feature count to over 344 million. 
We’re building on great work by the open data community, including folks on the [OpenAddresses](https://openaddresses.io/)
and [AddressForAll](https://www.addressforall.org/en/) projects. 

And now we're excited to share another new source of open data. Previously, Overture pulled all its address data 
in the United States from the [Department of Transportation’s National 
Address Database (NAD)](https://www.transportation.gov/gis/national-address-database). 
For the October release, we developed a cut-and-replace workflow to swap NAD data in New York City 
with data from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). Local data FTW! This is a process 
we will continue to refine so that we can more 
easily fold in new data to improve coverage and quality across all [Overture themes](https://docs.overturemaps.org/guides/).

## Roads and building heights
Also in the October release, you’ll find new data from [TomTom](https://www.tomtom.com/), representing 31,654 kilometers of roads in Saudi Arabia 
and Italy. We also added new building height data from both Microsoft and [Esri Community Maps contributors](https://communitymaps.arcgis.com/home/). 
These updates highlight Overture’s goal to improve data quality and coverage by incorporating new data in each release, 
with a focus on [data sources](https://docs.overturemaps.org/attribution/) that have more permissive open-source licenses.

Please [reach out to us on GitHub](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/discussions) if you have any questions or feedback. 
And if you have a suggestion for a new dataset, we’d love to hear about it.
