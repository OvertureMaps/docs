## Overview

**The `2026-02-18.0` release of Overture data and `v1.16.0` of the Overture schema are now available.** You can access the datasets, changelog, GERS registry, bridge files, and PMTiles on AWS and Azure at the paths listed below. 

## What's new?
In this release, we added a new `admin_level` property to the divisions schema to represent a division’s position in its country’s hierarchy, e.g. 0, 1, 2. We also updated our [places guide](/guides/places/taxonomy) with more information about our recent taxonomy work, including mappings across the `basic_category`, `taxonomy`, and `categories` properties. Last but not least, we updated our address data for Norway and made small improvements to our address schema thanks to [user feedback](https://github.com/orgs/OvertureMaps/discussions/451) from Johannes-Andersen. Keep the [comments](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/OvertureMaps/discussions) coming!


## Deprecations
The `categories` property in the places schema is now deprecated and will be removed in the June 2026 release, replaced by the new `basic_category` and `taxonomy` properties. All three properties will be available until then to ease the transition for our users.
