:::info

This release adds approximately 6 million new POIs from Foursquare Open Source Places (FSQ OS Places) to grow the coverage of our data. We selected these records as POIs not previously included in Overture. We plan to add more Foursquare data as our validation models mature. 
You can find the original source for FSQ OS Places [here](https://opensource.foursquare.com/os-places/).

### Overture Places is now a multi-license dataset
Previously, all Places data was under CDLA, but now each place has a license based on its source property:
- Foursquare-sourced data is licensed under [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
- Data from other sources remains licensed under [CDLA 2.0](https://cdla.dev/permissive-2-0/).
Note that all Foursquare-sourced data is single sourced, meaning we do not blend its attributes with any other sources.

### License requirements
If you use, modify, or redistribute the Foursquare data, you must:
- Provide a copy of the Apache 2.0 license.
- State that you changed the files and include the date of any changes.
- Preserve attribution notices from the source NOTICE file, including at minimum: `Copyright 2024 Foursquare Labs, Inc. All rights reserved.`

More information on license requirements and data usage is available on Foursquare’s [website](https://docs.foursquare.com/data-products/docs/access-fsq-os-places). General information on Overture licensing is available in the [licensing and attribution section](https://docs.overturemaps.org/attribution/) of Overture's documentation.

### How to filter for CDLA-only data
To create a purely CDLA-licensed dataset, filter out all records where the source property is “Foursquare”.
