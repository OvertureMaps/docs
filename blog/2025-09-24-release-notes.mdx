:::warning
With the September release, Overture is implementing a data retention policy for publicly-available data releases.

#### What's changing:
- Data releases will be publicly available for a maximum of 60 days (approximately two monthly releases)
- Data files will be automatically removed from public distribution after this period using cloud storage lifecycle policies

#### What remains available:
- The most recent two monthly data releases (last 60 days)
- Versioned changelogs and bridgefiles for all releases
- GERS registry
- Release notes from all past releases

#### Why we're implementing this:
This policy ensures compliance with data protection regulations, including GDPR "right to be forgotten" requirements.

You can find complete details about our release schedule and policies on the [releases](https://docs.overturemaps.org/release-calendar/) page in the Overture documentation. Questions? Comments? Please contribute to [this thread on our GitHub Discussions forum](https://github.com/orgs/OvertureMaps/discussions/422) or reach out to us at info@overturemaps.org.

## Overview

**The `2025-09-24.0` release of Overture data and `v1.12.0` of the Overture schema are now available.** The datasets and release artifacts are available as GeoParquet files stored on both AWS and Azure. There are several data updates and (minor) breaking schema changes in this release. 

## What's new?

### New POIs from Foursquare Open Source Places

This release adds approximately 6 million new POIs from Foursquare Open Source Places (FSQ OS Places) to grow the coverage of our data. We selected these records as POIs not previously included in Overture. We plan to add more Foursquare data as our validation models mature. 
You can find the original source for FSQ OS Places [here](https://opensource.foursquare.com/os-places/).

#### Overture places is now a multi-license dataset

Previously all places data was under a CDLA license, but in this release each place has a license based on its source property:
- Foursquare-sourced data is licensed under [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
- Data from other sources remains licensed under [CDLA 2.0](https://cdla.dev/permissive-2-0/).
Note that all Foursquare-sourced data is single sourced, meaning we do not blend its attributes with any other sources.

#### License requirements
If you use, modify, or redistribute the Foursquare data, you must:
- Provide a copy of the Apache 2.0 license.
- State that you changed the files and include the date of any changes.
- Preserve attribution notices from the source NOTICE file, including at minimum: `Copyright 2024 Foursquare Labs, Inc. All rights reserved.`

More information on license requirements and data usage is available on Foursquare’s [website](https://docs.foursquare.com/data-products/docs/access-fsq-os-places). General information on Overture licensing is available in the [licensing and attribution section](https://docs.overturemaps.org/attribution/) of Overture's documentation.

#### How to filter for CDLA-only data
To create a purely CDLA-licensed dataset, filter out all records where the source property is “Foursquare”.

### New schema properties 

This month we added a new `license` sub-property within the `sources` property to more clearly link entities to the licensing information for their source data. This change affects all Overture themes, as `sources` is [a top-level property](https://docs.overturemaps.org/schema/#top-level-properties) in the Overture schema. 

In the places theme, we added a new `operating_status` property, with all values set to "open". In future releases, we plan to update this property with data that indicates whether a place is "open", "permanently_closed", or "temporarily_closed".

### Signal "patches"
About a million POIs in our places theme now have a signal "patch" that determines the calculation of the score in the `confidence` property. POIs enhanced by these patches have "SparkGeo-confidence-conflation" in the `sources` property.


## Getting the data

You can access this month's data and release artifacts by following the process outlined [here](/getting-data). We encourage you to ask questions and provide feedback on the Overture Maps [Discussion forum on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/OvertureMaps/discussions). You can also file issues and report bugs in our [data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/issues) and [schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/issues) repositories.
