Welcome to the Overture Maps engineering blog! We're excited to tell the technical stories behind this big, exciting, ambitious, intensely collaborative project we’ve been [working on for more than a year](https://overturemaps.org/looking-forward-to-2024/). The engineers building Overture Maps are eager to connect with our developer community. In the posts we publish in the coming months, you’ll hear from team members who work at Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, TomTom, Esri, Development Seed, Precisely, and more. And we’d like to hear from you: [feedback and contributions](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/discussions) from folks working with our data and schema are crucial to our success. Thanks for joining us on this journey. We’re glad you’re here.
