August 26th, 2025

Today, Overture released a patch for the August data. The new release paths are:

#### Amazon S3 
```
s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2025-08-20.1
```

#### Microsoft Azure 
```
wasbs://release@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2025-08-20.1
```

During our final QA processes, we detected the following issue in the data: all Microsoft ML buildings were incorrectly assigned `"is_underground": true`. We decided to make the `2025-08-20.0
` release public with the bug and follow up with a patch to the data.
