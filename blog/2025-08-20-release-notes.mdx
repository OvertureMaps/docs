:::info

During our final QA processes, we detected the following issue in the data: all Microsoft ML buildings were incorrectly assigned `"is_underground": true`. We decided to make the `2025-08-20.0` release public with the bug and follow up with a patch to the data. Expect `2025-08-20.1` to be released shortly.
