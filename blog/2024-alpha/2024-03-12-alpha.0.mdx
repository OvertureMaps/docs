### Highlights
Here are the highlights of what's new and updated in Overture's `2024-03-12-alpha.0` release. This release includes a schema change from `camelCase` to `snake_case` for all property names and enumeration member names, an expansion of stable GERS IDs and incremental updates to the schema and datasets.

### Breaking changes
We changed `camelCase` to `snake_case` in the schema for properties to be more compatible with some SQL engines. This may break existing code and queries:

In previous releases of Overture data, we used `camelCase` for attribute names throughout the schema. A duckdb query to find Pennsylvania in our admins dataset might have looked like this:

```sql
LOAD spatial;
LOAD httpfs:

SELECT
   id,
   isoSubCountryCode,
   contextId,
   names.primary,
   ST_GeomFromWKB(geometry) as geometry
FROM
   read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-02-15-alpha.0/theme=admins/type=*/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)
WHERE type='locality'
   AND subType='administrativeLocality'
   AND adminLevel=2
   AND names.primary LIKE 'Pennsylvania';
```

In the March release, we changed all property names and enumeration member names to `snake_case`. This is a big one-time churn to improve SQL compatibility. That same query to find Pennsylvania now looks like this:

```sql
LOAD spatial;
LOAD httpfs:

SELECT
   id,
   iso_sub_country_code,
   context_id,
   names.primary,
   ST_GeomFromWKB(geometry) as geometry
FROM
   read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-03-12-alpha.0/theme=admins/type=*/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)
WHERE type='locality'
   AND subtype='administrative_locality'
   AND admin_level=2
   AND names.primary LIKE 'Pennsylvania';
```
```

### Deprecations
In the April 2024 release, Overture will implement a refactor of the `Admins` theme called `Divisions`. Admins and Divisions will coexist for three releases, at which point Divisions will fully replace Admins. More information on this change [here](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/discussions/117).
