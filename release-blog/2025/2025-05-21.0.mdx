## Overview

**The `2025-05-21.0` release of Overture data and `v1.9.0` of the Overture schema are now available.** 

The datasets are available as GeoParquet files stored on both AWS and Azure. The release paths are:

#### Microsoft Azure:
```
wasbs://release@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2025-05-21.0
```

#### Amazon S3:
```
s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2025-05-21.0
```

You can access the datasets by following the process outlined [here](/getting-data). We encourage you to ask questions and provide feedback on the Overture Maps [Discussions forum on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/OvertureMaps/discussions). You can also file issues and report bugs in our [data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/issues) and [schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/issues) repositories. If you have a suggestion for a new dataset or if you have data you'd like to contribute to Overture, you can email us at data@overturemaps.org. Weâ€™d love to hear from you.

## What's new? Bridge files!

Overture is now releasing bridge files alongside our monthly data releases. Bridge files map GERS IDs to source data IDs, providing a mechanism to trace the origin of data in the Overture corpus, including data that doesn't appear in our published releases.

Overture's approach to conflation is to handle the complexity internally and deliver a fully conflated, interoperable data product. While we publish this conflated data, we haven't previously made our internal GERS ID matching results available. Bridge files change this by sharing our conflation results, making it easier for you to understand data provenance and giving you an opportunity to be more provider-agnostic.

You can find the latest bridge files here:

## Big changes are coming

In next month's release (late June), Overture is standardizing the [`id` property](/schema/#top-level-properties) across all themes by adopting [UUID](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9562.html), stored as strings. 

Currently the structure of our IDs varies slightly across datasets, with some themes embedding metadata (e.g. [H3](https://h3geo.org/)) in the `id` property. The new UUIDs will be randomly-generated identifiers with no encoded information. Moving to UUIDs enables consistent ID generation and registration across our data pipelines, which is necessary for our successful implementation of [GERS](/gers). We plan to support our users by providing a file that maps the old IDs to the new UUIDs.
