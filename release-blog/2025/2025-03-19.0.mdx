March 20, 2025

Today Overture released a patch for the March data. There was an issue with a data pipeline process that caused `theme` and `type` columns to show up in some of the Parquet files. This issue likely had minimal, if any, impact on users.

The new release paths are:

#### Amazon S3 
```
s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2025-03-19.1
```

#### Microsoft Azure 
```
wasbs://release@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2025-03-19.1
```

## Overview

**The `2025-03-19.0` release of Overture data and `v1.7.0` of the Overture schema are now available.** 

The datasets are available as GeoParquet files stored on both AWS and Azure. The release paths are:
