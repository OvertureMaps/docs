## Overview

**The `2024-12-18.0` release of Overture data and `v1.4.0` of the Overture schema are now available.** This month [our transportation theme is going to GA](/blog), we're launching a [bathymetry feature type](/schema/reference/base/bathymetry) in our base theme, and we're at 400 million address records and counting in our [addresses theme](/guides/addresses). What a way to end the year!

The datasets are available as GeoParquet files stored on both AWS and Azure. The release paths are:

#### Microsoft Azure:
```
wasbs://release@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2024-12-18.0
```

#### Amazon S3:
```
s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-12-18.0
```

You can access the datasets by following the process outlined [here](/getting-data). We encourage you to ask questions, report bugs, and provide feedback via our [data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data) and [schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema) repositories on GitHub. If you have a suggestion for a new dataset or if you have data you'd like to contribute to Overture, you can email us at data@overturemaps.org. Weâ€™d love to hear from you.
