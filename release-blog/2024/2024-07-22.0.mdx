**The Overture `2024-07-22.0` data release and `v1.0.0` of the Overture schema are live.** Our base, buildings, divisions, and places themes are now in the General Availability (GA) phase of their development. Our transportation theme remains in beta, and the Overture transportation task force anticipates breaking changes in the next release. We also released a new addresses theme, available in alpha. The Overture addresses task force will be making significant changes to the schema and updating and adding to the data over the next several releases.

The datasets are available as GeoParquet files stored on AWS and Azure. The release paths are:

##### Microsoft Azure:
```
wasbs://release@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2024-07-22.0
```

##### Amazon S3:
```
s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-07-22.0
```

You can access the datasets by following the process outlined [here](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/). We encourage users to report bugs and provide feedback on the data, schema, and GERS on one of our Overture GitHub repositories:

- [Schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema)
- [Data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data)
- [Docs](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/docs)
- [Python command-line tool](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py)
- [Explore site](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/io-site)

### New theme: addresses

In this release, we added a new theme called [addresses](/schema/reference/addresses/address) that includes over 200 million address features for 14 countries. We are releasing this theme in alpha and anticipate significant changes over the next several releases. We invite the Overture community to test the addresses schema and data and offer feedback via the [data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/issues) and [schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/issues) repos.

### Global Entity Reference System (GERS) changelog

The GERS changelog captures any changes in Overture features between this release and the previous release. The changelog is available as Parquet files &mdash; partitioned by theme, type, and change type &mdash; at the following locations on Azure and AWS:

```
wasbs://changelog@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2024-07-22.0
```
```
s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/changelog/2024-07-22.0
```

The types of feature changes in the changelog include:

- `added`: Feature with this ID is new (was not present in the previous release).
- `removed`: Feature with this ID was present in the previous release, but not this release.
- `data_changed`: The feature with this ID contains a change in attributes (geometry or otherwise) from the feature with this ID in the previous release.
- `unchanged`: The feature with this ID in this release matches the geometry and attributes of the feature with this ID in the previous release.



### Breaking changes

In the divisions theme, we changed the `boundary` feature type to `division_boundary`. Feature types in Overture must be distinct and unique across all themes, and `boundary` did not meet those conditions. We realize that changing the name of a feature type is a major change, and we do not anticipate doing this again without giving our users plenty of advance notice. 

Also in the divisions theme, we changed the `divisions` property to `divisions_ids` to fix relationship modeling in the schema. The logic is that a property or nested sub-property that contains a foreign key reference to another feature by Overture ID must end in the suffix `_id`. More information about this change here: https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/pull/215

We removed `update_time` from a top-level schema property to a property within the sources structure. For example, the Microsoft buildings `update_time` comes from Microsoft's imagery capture data:
```
[{property=, dataset=Microsoft ML Buildings, record_id=709fc8cf0b55, update_time=2023-06-23T00:00:00.000Z, confidence=null}]
```


### Deprecations

In the transportation theme, we deprecated the `road` JSON column in the June release and removed it in the current release. We replaced the `road` JSON column with structured Parquet columns for road attributes.

In April, we deprecated the admins theme and offered the divisions theme as a replacement. We removed admins in this release and are no longer supporting it. You can still access the admins data and schema in previous Overture releases.
