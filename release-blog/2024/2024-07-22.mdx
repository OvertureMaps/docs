### GERS changelog

We are now publishing a GERS changelog that captures feature changes by Overture ID from the previous release to the current release. The changelog is available as Parquet files &mdash; partitioned by theme, type, and `change_type` &mdash; at the following locations:

```

```

Valid values for the `change_type` include:
- added: Overture ID is new and was not in the previous release
- removed: Overture ID is not in the current release and was in the previous release
- data_changed: Overture ID is in the current release and was in the previous release and the feature's attributes or geometry have changed
- unchanged: Overture ID is in the current release and was in the previous release, and the feature's attributes and geometry have not changed 



### Breaking changes

- removed `update_time` from a top-level schema property to a property within the sources structure
 
### Deprecations

In the transportation theme, we deprecated the road JSON column in the June release and removed it in the current release. We replaced the road JSON column with structured Parquet columns for road attributes.

In April, we deprecated the admins theme and offered the divisions theme as a replacement. We removed admins in this release and are no longer supporting it. You can still access the admins data and schema in previous Overture releases. 


### Theme-specific updates

**Divisions**

- added the dependency subtype in `division` and `division_area`
- added the microhood subtype in `division`
- made incremental improvements to the data

**Base**

- removed `update_time` from top level buildings schema
- added `update_time` to the sources structure 
- added `update_time` to the sources structure for building parts
- capped `height` and `roof_height` at 850 meters and discarded values over that limit
- added a test to check that building `min_height` is less than `height`
- included building parts inside building relation outline even when part is not an explicit member
- resolved issue with building and building_part polygons having identical geometries
