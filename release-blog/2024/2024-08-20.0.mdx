**Overture's `2024-08-20.0` data release is now available.** The base, buildings, divisions, and places themes are stable, which means the only changes this month are data improvements and bug fixes. The transportation theme remains in beta and we have made several significant changes to the schema in this release. The addresses theme is in alpha.

The datasets are available as GeoParquet files stored on AWS and Azure. The release paths are:

##### Microsoft Azure:
```
wasbs://release@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2024-08-20.0
```

##### Amazon S3:
```
s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-08-20.0
```

You can access the datasets by following the process outlined [here](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/). We encourage users to report bugs and provide feedback on the data, schema, and GERS on one of our Overture GitHub repositories:
