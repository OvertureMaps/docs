## Overview

**The `2024-10-23.0` release of Overture data and `v1.2.0` of the Overture schema are now available.** As part of Overture's effort to expand our data sources, 
we added in this release address data from several sources, transportation data from TomTom, and building height data from Microsoft and Esri Community Maps contributors. 

The October release is available as GeoParquet files stored on both AWS and Azure. The release paths are:

#### Microsoft Azure:
```
wasbs://release@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2024-10-23.0
```

#### Amazon S3:
```
s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-10-23.0
```
:::note
We are now releasing Overture's GeoParquet files in accordance with the [GeoParquet v1.1.0 specification](https://geoparquet.org/releases/v1.1.0/), 
with the covering metadata included. So you can now do this:
```
ogr2ogr --config AWS_NO_SIGN_REQUEST=yes -spat -71.068 42.353 -71.058 42.363  
-f GeoJSON output.geojson
/vsis3/overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-10-23.0/theme=buildings/type=building/
```
:::

You can access the datasets by following the process outlined [here](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/). We encourage users to report bugs and provide feedback on the data and schema on GitHub:

- [Schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema)
- [Data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data)

## Breaking changes

We removed the `connector_ids` property from the schema and replaced it with a new `connectors` property. You'll find more information about this change [here](https://docs.overturemaps.org/blog/2024/08/15/preview-august-release/#connectors).

## Deprecations

In the `2024-08-20.0` [release notes](https://docs.overturemaps.org/release/2024-08-20.0/), we announced the deprecation of the `connector_ids` property in the transportation schema. We have removed that property in this release.
