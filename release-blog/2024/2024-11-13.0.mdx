## Overview

**The `2024-11-13.0` release of Overture data and `v1.3.0` of the Overture schema are now available.** This release includes more than 66 unique address datasets from many new [sources](/attribution). We added a new `postal_city` column to the addresses schema to support address formatting. In the transportation schema, we dropped the unutilized `lanes` column in preparation for transportation's GA release in December. 

The November release is available as GeoParquet files stored on both AWS and Azure. The release paths are:

#### Microsoft Azure:
```
wasbs://release@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2024-11-13.0
```

#### Amazon S3:
```
s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-11-13.0
```
:::note
We are now releasing Overture's GeoParquet files in accordance with the [GeoParquet v1.1.0 specification](https://geoparquet.org/releases/v1.1.0/), with the covering metadata included.
:::

You can access the datasets by following the process outlined [here](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/). We encourage you to ask questions, report bugs, and provide feedback via our [data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data) and [schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema) repositories on GitHub. If you have a suggestion for a new dataset or if you have data you'd like to contribute to Overture, you can email us at **data AT overturemaps.org**. Weâ€™d love to hear from you.


## Breaking changes

We removed the `lanes` column from the transportation schema, as we have not had the data to populate it since its implementation many months ago. It's unlikely this will be a breaking change for most users, but we are erring on the side of caution and including this information here. We intend to introduce a reimagined, data-rich lanes property in 2025. 

## Deprecations

 None.
