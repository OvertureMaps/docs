## Overview

**The `2024-11-13.0` release of Overture data and `v1.3.0` of the Overture schema are now available.** This release includes more than 66 unique address datasets from many new [sources](/attribution). We added a new `postal_city` column to the addresses schema to support address formatting. In the transportation schema, we dropped the unutilized `lanes` column in preparation for transportation's GA release in December. The places theme moved from GA back to beta status. 

The November release is available as GeoParquet files stored on both AWS and Azure. The release paths are:

#### Microsoft Azure:
```
wasbs://release@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2024-11-13.0
```

#### Amazon S3:
```
s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-11-13.0
```
:::note
We are now releasing Overture's GeoParquet files in accordance with the [GeoParquet v1.1.0 specification](https://geoparquet.org/releases/v1.1.0/), with the covering metadata included.
:::

You can access the datasets by following the process outlined [here](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/). We encourage you to ask questions, report bugs, and provide feedback via our [data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data) and [schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema) repositories on GitHub. If you have a suggestion for a new dataset or if you have data you'd like to contribute to Overture, you can email us at **data AT overturemaps.org**. We’d love to hear from you.


## Breaking changes

We removed the `lanes` column from the transportation schema, as we have not had the data to populate it since its implementation many months ago. It's unlikely this is a breaking change for most users, but we are ering on the side of caution and including this information here. We intend to introduce a reimagined, data-rich lanes property in 2025. 

## Deprecations

 None.
