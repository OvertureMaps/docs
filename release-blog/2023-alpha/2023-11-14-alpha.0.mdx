### Highlights
Overture `2023-11-14-alpha.0` is now available. This is an incremental release that includes several improvements to the data quality and coverage as well as updates for data currency. More information about these additions is available in the relevant sections below.

This data is formatted in the Overture Data Schema unless otherwise noted.

This data is available for use under the designated licenses for each theme. While Overture intends to release open map data on a regular cadence in the future, the date of subsequent releases has not yet been established.

We would like feedback on the data, its usefulness, and how it could be improved. Please use this Github repo for discussions and feedback related to this data release.

Overture `2023-11-14-alpha.0` is available in cloud-native Parquet and stored on AWS and Azure.

### Changelog
See our [changelog](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/releases/tag/v0.6.0) here.

### Theme-specific updates
Overture `2023-11-14-alpha.0` is released in five themes. Updated to Geo Parquet format for this release:

**Transportation Theme**
The Transportation theme includes the following improvements:
- Collective OSM changes through October 15th, updated and converted to Overture’s Schema.
- Over 1.5 million turn restrictions worldwide.

:::note
The data includes some provisional Global Entity Reference System (GERS) data which is used to express relationships between road segments. This may not be representative of the final GERS format and should not be the basis for long-term development work.
:::

Data in the Transportation theme is licensed under ODbL.

**Base Theme**
All of the features in the base theme are from OpenStreetMap, sourced via the Daylight Map Distribution. Most original OSM tags remain on all features. Some tags become normalized and added as top-level properties, such as the surface or wikidata tags.

Data in the Base theme is licensed under ODbL.

**Buildings Theme**
The dataset includes 1.4B conflated building footprints from OSM, Esri Community Maps, and Microsoft ML Building Footprints. Similar to the previous release, the order of conflation is OpenStreetMap -> Esri Community Maps -> Microsoft ML Building Footprints. For example, if Esri has a building that does not exist in OSM, we take that building, then, we “fill-in” the rest of the map with any Microsoft ML buildings that do not intersect with either OSM or Esri.

We've made some incremental improvements to further ensure the data conforms to the buildings layer schema.

The sources of the buildings theme include OpenStreetMap, Microsoft Building footprints, and Esri Community Partners. Some building heights have also been derived using lidar from USGS 3DEP.

Data in the Buildings theme is licensed under ODbL.

**Places Theme**
This release has over 57M place records. The Places theme in this release includes incremental improvements to improve the accuracy and quality of the dataset:
- Corrected missing postal codes from the previous release (2023-10-19-alpha.0).
- New data has been included to improve category coverage.

Data in the Places theme is licensed under CDLA Permissive 2.0.

**Administrative Boundaries (Admins) Theme**
The Admins theme in this release includes several modifications to improve schema of the dataset:
- We added ability for admins to have point and area, in future multiple areas like landmass and maritime area
- Fixed issue with invalid format of updateTime property

:::note
Known issues:
- Second-level subdivision did not undergo worldwide inspection of quality so some missing or wrong data is expected.
- All first-level subdivisions have type=state and all second-level subdivisions have type=county which is not always true, we plan to address this issue in following releases.
- We plan to use admin_level=8,9,10 to add polygons to cities, towns, villages and other localities when available depending on individual country mapping.
:::

The sources of the admin theme are OpenStreetMap and Esri. The Administrative Boundary data is in the Overture Maps data schema for Admin.

Data in the Admin theme is licensed under ODbL.
