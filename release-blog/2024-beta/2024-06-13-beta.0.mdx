Overture's `2024-06-13-beta.0` release is available in GeoParquet and stored on AWS and Azure. You can access the datasets by following the process outlined [here](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/). We encourage users to report bugs and provide feedback on the data, schema, and GERS via any publicly-available Overture Maps repository on GitHub: 

- [Schema](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema)
- [Data](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data)
- [Docs](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/docs)
- [Python command-line tool](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py)
- [Explore site](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/io-site)

Depending on the feedback, we anticipate moving to a production release soon.


### Breaking changes

Based on feedback from developers and data analysts in the Overture ecosystem, we simplified ("flattened") the structure of our road data to make it easier to query road attributes. We included the now deprecated road JSON column in this release to make the transition easier for users.

        <summary>Breaking change in structure of road data</summary>
        <div>

| old JSON path	| new Parquet column | 
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| road.restrictions.speed_limits |	speed_limits |
| road.restrictions.access	| access_restrictions |
| road.restrictions.prohibited_transitions | prohibited_transitions |
| road.surface | road_surface |
| road.flags | road_flags |
| road.width | width_rules |
| road.lanes | lanes |
| road.level | level_rules |

Also in this release, we simplified the non-geometry vehicle scoping block.

### Deprecations

In the transportation theme, we deprecated the road JSON column and will remove it in the next release. We replaced the road JSON column with structured Parquet columns.

We deprecated the `admins` theme and replaced it with `divisions`. This will be the last supported release for `admins`. In the next release, `admins` data will be available in an archive but not supported. 

### Schema Changelog

See our [changelog](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/releases) here.

### Theme-specific updates

**Divisions/Admins**

- added support for MultiLineString geometries to improve the stability of Overture IDs for boundary features
- extended the schema to support multiple capitals of a division
- added the option to include or exclude boundaries based on perspectives
- updated OpenStreetMap data to 2024.06.05
- changed modeling of municipalities/cities in Brazil from counties to localities, which we believe better reflects ground truth
- made improvements to the names data and fixed several bugs 

**Base**

- added the `elevated_surface` attribute to infrastructure and land feature types
- made incremental updates from OSM, based on Daylight v1.48
- added a new cartographic property: `sort_key`

**Buildings**

- made regular updates to buildings, including adding the latest open data from OSM, Esri Community Maps, and Microsoft 
- expanded the previous definition of class for buildings to include specific amenity tags that are either already an official Overture place category or can be matched to one

**Places**

- began a comprehensive audit of data quality
- continued building our places matcher 

**Transportation**

:::warning
- Breaking change: transformed `segment` properties from JSON structured parquet columns
- Breaking change: restructured vehicle constraint property
:::
