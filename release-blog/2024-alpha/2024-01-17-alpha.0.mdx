### Changelog
See our [changelog](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/releases/tag/v0.8.0) here.

### Theme-specific updates
Overture `2024-01-17-alpha.0` is released in five themes.

**Buildings Theme**
The dataset includes 2.35B conflated building footprints from OSM, Esri Community Maps, Microsoft ML Building Footprints, and Google Open Buildings.
The order of conflation is OpenStreetMap → Esri Community Maps → high precision Google Open Buildings → Microsoft ML Building Footprints → lower precision Google Open Buildings. For example, if Esri has a building that does not exist in OSM, we take that building, then we “fill-in” the rest of the map with any ML buildings that do not intersect with either OSM or Esri.
We use the 90% precision confidence threshold to delineate between high and lower precision for Google Open Buildings, this threshold varies per s2 cell.

We've made incremental improvements to further ensure the data conforms to the buildings layer schema.

3d attributes from OSM, such as roof shape, are now available.

The sources of the buildings theme include OpenStreetMap, Esri Community Maps, Microsoft Building footprints, and Google Open Buildings. Some building heights have also been derived using lidar from USGS 3DEP.

Data in the Buildings theme is licensed under ODbL.

**Transportation Theme**
Refreshed data to include OSM data up to Dec 19

:::note
GERS IDs for connectors and segments should now be considered stable for future releases
:::

Data in the Transportation theme is licensed under ODbL.

**Base Theme**
All of the features in the base theme are from OpenStreetMap, sourced via the latest Daylight Map Distribution (v1.38).

Includes 43M water features, 63M land features, and 44M land use features.

Most original OSM tags remain on all features. Some tags become normalized and added as top-level properties, such as the surface or wikidata tags.

Data in the Base theme is licensed under ODbL.

**Places Theme**
This release has over 57M place records.

The Places theme in this release includes incremental improvements to improve the accuracy and quality of the dataset.

Data in the Places theme is licensed under CDLA Permissive 2.0.

**Administrative Boundaries (Admins) Theme**
Minor improvements on second-level subdivision of countries.
Data from OSM is updated to 15th of January.

This is first release with "geopolDisplay" property set on boundaries.

Known issues:
- Second-level subdivision are still not complete world-wide, as we search for data sources that are compatible with ODbL.
- All first-level subdivisions have type=state and all second-level subdivisions have type=county which is not always true, we plan to address this issue in following release.
- We plan to use admin_level=8,9,10 to add polygons to cities, towns, villages and other localities when available depending on individual country mapping.

The sources of the admin theme are OpenStreetMap and Esri. The Administrative Boundary data is in the Overture Maps data schema for Admin.

Data in the Admin theme is licensed under ODbL.
