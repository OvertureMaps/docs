[QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/), an open source geographic information system can read a number of geospatial data formats. To read Overture data with QGIS, we just need to obtain the data we want in a format that is compatible with QGIS:


#### First, Install a version of QGIS that can read `parquet`.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS" default>
        The [conda packages](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qgis) of QGIS have support for Parquet.

        You can find the latest installers for Mac here: [github.com/opengisch/qgis-conda-builder/releases](https://github.com/opengisch/qgis-conda-builder/releases)
    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
        Most distributions of QGIS for Windows have support for parquet.

    <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>
        The [conda packages](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qgis) of QGIS have support for Parquet.

        Additionally, there is a Flatpak QGIS package that includes support for Parquet:

        ```bash
        flatpak install --user https://dl.flathub.org/build-repo/94031/org.qgis.qgis.flatpakref
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Next, Download some Overture data in parquet format
Overture data is distributed as a series of hundreds of geoparquet files. These files are partitioned as follows: theme/type/location. For example,

If I'm downloading data through DuckDB, why shouldn't I just use the `spatial` extension to convert it to a shapefile, GeoJSON, etc.?
