[QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/), an open source geographic information system can read a number of geospatial data formats. To read Overture data with QGIS, we just need to obtain the data we want in a format that is compatible with QGIS.

DuckDB's spatial extension is capable of writing data to any number of GDAL

Alternatively, any build of QGIS that includes GDAL > 3.5 is capable of reading parquet data. We recommend trying this.

### Downloading Overture data in parquet format
Overture data is distributed as a series of hundreds of geoparquet files. These files are partitioned as follows: theme/type/location. For example
