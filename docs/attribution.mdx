title: Attribution and Licensing
---

If you are the author of a publication or research report that uses Overture data, you may choose to add the following citation, including the date the data were accessed: `Overture Maps Foundation, overturemaps.org`.

The Overture Maps Foundation does not require text attribution or an OMF logo on maps, visualizations, and graphics created with our datasets. If you would like to credit Overture, we suggest: `© Overture Maps Foundation`. Some of the data sources we use in Overture datasets do require their own attribution, according to their licenses. For example, our [Explore tool](https://explore.overturemaps.org/) displays several Overture datasets that are made wholly or in part from OpenStreetMap data, so we added the following line of attribution to adhere to the requirements of the [Open Database License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/):
`© OpenStreetMap contributors, Overture Maps Foundation`.
