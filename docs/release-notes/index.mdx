### **`2024-04-16-beta.0` release**

Here are the highlights for what's new and updated in the Overture Maps `2024-04-16-beta.0` release. The "beta" designation indicates the data and schema are largely stable. 

Overture Maps `2024-04-16-beta.0` is available in GeoParquet and stored on AWS and Azure. Users can select the data of interest and download it by following the process outlined [here](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/).

We encourage developers wishing to adopt Overture Maps base layers to begin evaluating and providing [feedback on the data, schema, and GERS IDs](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/discussions). Depending on the feedback from this release and subsequent releases, we anticipate moving to a production release in the next few months.   

## Breaking changes
We renamed the `bbox` column fields to align with the upcoming [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/) 1.1 spec. 

```
minx → xmin
miny → ymin
maxx → xmax
maxy → ymax
```

The fields are all now [Parquet Float (32-bit)](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/types/) where as they had previously been distributed as Double (64-bit).

## Deprecations
In this release, we implemented the schema for a refactor of the `admins` theme called `divisions`. The `divisions` data will be available in our May release. After that, the two themes will coexist for two additional releases (June and July), at which point `divisions` will fully replace `admins`. More information on why we made this change [here](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/discussions/117).

## Theme-specific updates
See [here](data-attribution) for information about licensing and data attribution for each theme.

**Administrative Boundaries Admins/Divisions**
- Included OSM data up to 4/8.
- Implemented the schema for the `divisions` theme, which has a better defined schema supporting perspectives, different types of polygons, and other new features.
- Note: see information above about the deprecation of `admins`.

**Base**
- Included OSM data up to 3/16 (sourced via Daylight Map Distribution v1.44).
- Included 46M water features, 55M land features, 40M land use features, and 48M infrastructure features.
- Maintained the original OSM tags remain on all features.
- Normalized and added `elevation`, `surface`, and `wikidata` as top-level properties.

**Buildings**
- Included OSM data up to 3/16 (sourced via Daylight Map Distribution v1.44).
- Included 2.35B conflated building footprints from OSM, Esri Community Maps, Microsoft ML Building Footprints, and Google Open Buildings.
- Made incremental improvements to further ensure the data conforms to the buildings layer schema.
- Added 3d attributes from OSM, such as roof shape.
- Note: The order of conflation is OpenStreetMap → Esri Community Maps → high precision Google Open Buildings → Microsoft ML Building Footprints → lower precision Google Open Buildings. For example, if Esri has a building that does not exist in OSM, we take that building, then we “fill-in” the rest of the map with any ML buildings that do not intersect with either OSM or Esri. We use the 90% precision confidence threshold to delineate between high and lower precision for Google Open Buildings, this threshold varies per s2 cell.


**Places**
- Included ~53 million place records.
- Included stable GERS IDs propagated from the previous release; roughly 51 million of the IDs are propagated and 2 million are new.
- Made incremental changes to improve the accuracy and quality of the dataset.

**Transportation**
- Included OSM data up to 4/7.
- Classified 12.2M segments as path.
- Added `is_covered` flag to denote partially enclosed segments.
- Improved scope merging; fewer access restrictions entries are now required.
- Fixed a projection issue affecting segment length calculation and linear referencing
- Promoted `class` to a top-level property.
- Moved `level` property into `road` property to allow linear referencing. 84% of all segments which had previously dropped `level` will now have that information.
- Renamed `at` to `between` for ranged linear referencing. 
- Removed `mode_not` scoping.



# Previous releases

### **`2024-03-12-alpha.0` release**

Here are the highlights of what's new and updated in Overture's `2024-03-12-alpha.0` release. This release includes a schema change from `camelCase` to `snake_case` for all property names and enumeration member names, an expansion of stable GERS IDs and incremental updates to the schema and datasets. More detailed [schema release notes and a changelog](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/releases/tag/v0.9.0) are available in the `OvertureMaps/schema`.

## Breaking changes
We changed `camelCase` to `snake_case` in the schema for properties to be more compatible with some SQL engines. This may break existing code and queries. See [here for an example](/release-notes/breaking-changes) of how this breaking change affects a query to the Admins dataset.

## Deprecations
In the April 2024 release, Overture will implement a refactor of the `Admins` theme called `Divisions`. Admins and Divisions will coexist for three releases, at which point Divisions will fully replace Admins. More information on this change [here](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/discussions/117).

## Theme-specific updates
The data sources for each theme are cited [here](/release-notes/data-attribution).

**Transportation**
- Refreshed to include OSM data up to 2024-03-03.
- Added ferry and alley segments.
- Included 125K previously unsupported turn restrictions.
- Added support for max weight, height, width and length access restrictions.
- Added one-way road access restrictions.
- Added road widths property to segments.
- Acheived stability of GERS IDs for connectors and segments for this and future releases.
- Note: data in the transportation theme is licensed under ODbL.

**Administrative Boundaries (Admins)**
- Refreshed to include OSM data up to 2024-03-07.
- Adapted schema to use `snake_case` to make attribute names more compatible with some SQL engines.
- Correctly set locality types.
- Made minor fixes:
     - All country localities now have ISO codes.
     - All non-country localities now have context property set.
- Note: data in the Admin theme is licensed under ODbL.

**Places**
- Achieved roughly 54 million place records.
- Propagated stable GERS IDs from the previous release.
- Made incremental improvements to accuracy and data quality.
- Note: data in the Places theme is licensed under CDLA Permissive 2.0.

**Buildings**
- Exposed the logic Overture uses to transform OSM tags into building attributes.
- Made incremental improvements to further ensure the data conforms to the buildings schema.
- Note: data in the Buildings theme is licensed under ODbL.

**Base**
- Exposed the logic Overture uses to transform OSM tags into attributes in the land use, land and water data types.
- Made incremental improvements to further ensure the data conforms to the base schema.
- Note: data in the Base theme is licensed under ODbL.
