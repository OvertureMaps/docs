## **`2024-04-16-beta.0` release**

### Highlights
Here are the highlights for what's new and updated in the Overture Maps `2024-04-16-beta.0` release. The "beta" designation indicates the data and schema are largely stable. 

Overture Maps `2024-04-16-beta.0` is available in GeoParquet and stored on AWS and Azure. Users can select the data of interest and download it by following the process outlined [here](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/).

We encourage developers wishing to adopt Overture Maps base layers to begin evaluating and providing [feedback on the data, schema, and GERS IDs](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/discussions). Depending on the feedback from this release and subsequent releases, we anticipate moving to a production release in the next few months.   

### Breaking changes
We renamed the `bbox` column fields to align with the upcoming [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/) 1.1 spec. 

```
minx → xmin
miny → ymin
maxx → xmax
maxy → ymax
```

The fields are all now [Parquet Float (32-bit)](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/types/) where as they had previously been distributed as Double (64-bit).

### Deprecations
In this release, we implemented a refactor of the `admins` theme called `divisions`. The `divisions` schema and data are [now available](/guides/divisions). The two themes will coexist for two subsequent releases (May 2024 and June 2024), at which point `divisions` will fully replace `admins`. More information on why we made this change [here](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/discussions/117).

### Changelog
See our [changelog](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/releases) here.

### Theme-specific updates
See [here](attribution) for information about licensing and data attribution for each theme.

**Administrative Boundaries Admins/Divisions**
- Included OSM data up to 4/8.
- Implemented the schema for the `divisions` theme, which has a better defined schema supporting perspectives, different types of polygons, and other new features.
- Note: see information above about the deprecation of `admins`.

**Base**
- Included OSM data up to 3/16 (sourced via Daylight Map Distribution v1.44).
- Included 46M water features, 55M land features, 40M land use features, and 48M infrastructure features.
- Maintained the original OSM tags remain on all features.
- Normalized and added `elevation`, `surface`, and `wikidata` as top-level properties.

**Buildings**
- Included OSM data up to 3/16 (sourced via Daylight Map Distribution v1.44).
- Included 2.35B conflated building footprints from OSM, Esri Community Maps, Microsoft ML Building Footprints, and Google Open Buildings.
- Made incremental improvements to further ensure the data conforms to the buildings layer schema.
- Added 3d attributes from OSM, such as roof shape.
- Note: The order of conflation is OpenStreetMap → Esri Community Maps → high precision Google Open Buildings → Microsoft ML Building Footprints → lower precision Google Open Buildings. For example, if Esri has a building that does not exist in OSM, we take that building, then we “fill-in” the rest of the map with any ML buildings that do not intersect with either OSM or Esri. We use the 90% precision confidence threshold to delineate between high and lower precision for Google Open Buildings, this threshold varies per s2 cell.


**Places**
- Included ~53 million place records.
- Included stable GERS IDs propagated from the previous release; roughly 51 million of the IDs are propagated and 2 million are new.
- Made incremental changes to improve the accuracy and quality of the dataset.

**Transportation**
- Included OSM data up to 4/7.
- Classified 12.2M segments as path.
- Added `is_covered` flag to denote partially enclosed segments.
- Improved scope merging; fewer access restrictions entries are now required.
- Fixed a projection issue affecting segment length calculation and linear referencing
- Promoted `class` to a top-level property.
- Moved `level` property into `road` property to allow linear referencing. 84% of all segments which had previously dropped `level` will now have that information.
- Renamed `at` to `between` for ranged linear referencing. 
- Removed `mode_not` scoping.
