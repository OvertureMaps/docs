# AddressLevel

An address "admin level".

We want to avoid the phrase "admin level" and have chosen "address level". These
represent states, regions, districts, cities, neighborhoods, etc. The address schema
defines several numbered levels with per-country rules indicating which parts of a
country's address goes to which numbered level.
