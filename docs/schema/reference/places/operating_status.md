# OperatingStatus

General indication of whether a place is: in continued operation, in a temporary operating
hiatus, or closed permanently.

Operating status should not be confused with opening hours or operating hours. In particular,
the status `"open"` does not mean the place is open *right now*, it means that in general the
place is continuing to operate normally, as opposed to being in an operating hiatus
(`"temporarily_closed"`) or shuttered (`"permanently_closed"`).

## Values

- `open`
- `permanently_closed`
- `temporarily_closed`
