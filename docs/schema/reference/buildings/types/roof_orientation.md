# RoofOrientation

Orientation of the roof shape relative to the footprint shape.

The members of this enumeration, `"across"` and `"along"`, are borrowed from the OpenStreetMap
`roof:orientation=*` tag and have the same meanings as they do in OSM.

## Values

- `across` - The roof ridge runs perpendicular to the longer of the two building edges, parallel to the shorter
- `along` - The roof ridge runs parallel to the longer of the two building edges

## Used By

- [`Building`](../building.md)
- [`BuildingPart`](../building_part.md)
