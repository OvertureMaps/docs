## What is an Overture ID?

Every feature in an Overture dataset is assigned a unique 128-bit ID called an Overture ID. The Overture ID provides a mechanism for structuring, encoding, and matching map data. In the example below, you can see the Overture IDs for five `building` type features in Overture's May 2024 release. 

```sql
D SET s3_region='us-west-2';
D SELECT id FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-05-16-beta.0/theme=buildings/type=buiding/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1) limit 5;
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│                id                │
│             varchar              │
├──────────────────────────────────┤

└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Stability and traceability

[For some feature types, Overture IDs are intended to be stable](stability) &mdash; within a reasonable tolerance of error &mdash; across multiple releases of Overture data. When stability is not possible, we will attempt to provide traceability in a changelog. For example:

- a single road segment is bisected by a new road and becomes two road segments: 1 unique Overture ID → 2 new unique Overture IDs;
- a large building footprint is determined to be four smaller buildings when a higher resolution dataset becomes available: 1 Overture ID → 4 new Overture IDs;
- a building is shifted 2 meters to the west when higher resolution imagery is made available: the Overture ID is preserved for that feature.

## Using Overture IDs

 We intend for Overture IDs to be used in the following ways:

1. **Associating data.** Users can independently match their own data with an Overture dataset and assign existing Overture IDs to the individual features in their data that match features in Overture data. 

2. **Contributing data.** If an organization contributes data to the Overture Maps Foundation, our engineering team will compare those data to existing features in Overture. Matched features will be assigned existing Overture IDs, and new features will be assigned new Overture IDs.
