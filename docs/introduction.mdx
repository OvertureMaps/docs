Welcome! In this documentation, you'll find [detailed instructions](getting-data) for accessing and handling Overture's large datasets, [reference material](https://docs.overturemaps.org/schema/) to better understand the Overture schema, and [hands-on examples](examples) to help you start exploring and building. Want to see what the Overture community has been making? Check out the [community projects](community) section of our documentation.

## Overture data 
Overture provides free and open map data normalized to a common schema. Our six data "themes" contain more than 3.7 billion features and ~600GB of data and will continue to expand in size and scale. We are currently focused on building the following datasets, organized by theme and type: 

- [addresses](guides/addresses)
- [base: water, land, land use, infrastructure, land cover](guides/base)
- [buildings](guides/buildings)
- [divisions](guides/divisions)
- [places](guides/places)
- [transportation](guides/transportation)


## Vision

The [member companies of the Overture Maps Foundation](https://overturemaps.org/about/members/) are working collaboratively to build the datasets and schema. They share a common vision:

### Address the core, enable the periphery
The Overture schema doesn't solve every problem. It offers complete, out-of-the-box solutions for the most fundamental "core" use cases. At the same time, the schema's extensible structure enables a wide range of other use cases ("the periphery").

### Invent across the gap
The mapping community already has access to many excellent tools, standards and practices. The Overture schema reuses these existing solutions to maximize compatibility and focus on solving unaddressed pain points.

### Backward-compatible is forward-compatible
No design is future-proof, but good designs stay relevant by adding features without breaking what already works. The Overture schema can be enhanced in a backward-compatible way.

### Always open
The Overture schema and data formats aim for compatibility with free and open-source tools, avoiding dependency on proprietary technologies.
