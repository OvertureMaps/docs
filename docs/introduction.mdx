## Welcome! 

Overture provides free and open map data normalized to a common schema. We are currently focused on making the following datasets: 

- [addresses](guides/address)
- [base: water, land, land use, infrastructure, land cover](guides/base)
- [buildings](guides/buildings)
- [divisions](guides/divisions)
- [places](guides/places)
- [transportation](guides/transportation)

In this documentation, you'll find [reference](https://docs.overturemaps.org/schema) material, [instructions](getting-data) for accessing our data, and [hands-on examples](examples) to help you start exploring and building.

## Vision

The [member companies of the Overture Maps Foundation](https://overturemaps.org/about/members/) are working collaboratively to build the datasets and schema. They share a common vision:

**Address the core, enable the periphery.** The Overture schema doesn't solve every problem. It offers complete, out-of-the-box solutions for the most fundamental "core" use cases. At the same time, the schema's extensible structure enables a wide range of other use cases ("the periphery").

**Invent across the gap.** The mapping community already has access to many excellent tools, standards and practices. The Overture schema reuses these existing solutions to maximize compatibility and focus on solving unaddressed pain points.

**Backward-compatible is forward-compatible.** No design is future-proof, but good designs stay relevant by adding features without breaking what already works. The Overture schema can be enhanced in a backward-compatible way.

**Always open.** The Overture schema and data formats aim for compatibility with free and open-source tools, avoiding dependency on proprietary technologies.
