title: GERS ID Stability
draft: true
---

At the feature `type` level, Overture strives to maintain stability of GERS IDs from one release to another. Currently, we consider the IDs for the following feature types to be stable:

| `theme` | `type` | Stable GERS ID |
|-------|------|-----------|
| `buildings` | `building` | Yes |
| `divisions` | `division` | Yes |
| `places` | `place` | Yes |
| `transportation` | `segment` | Yes |
| `transportation` | `connector` | Yes |


We are working toward ID stability for the follow feature types:

| `theme` | `type` | Stable GERS ID |
|-------|------|-----------|
| `addresses` | `address` | No |
| `base` | `bathymetry` | No |
| `base` | `infrastructure` | No |
| `base` | `land` | No |
| `base` | `land_cover` | No |
| `base` | `land_use` | No |
| `base` | `water` | No |
| `buildings` | `building_part` | No |
| `divisions` | `division_area` | No |
| `divisions` | `division_boundary` | No |
