title: Stability by Feature Type
---

All features in Overture have a unique ID, and for some feature types those unique IDs, called Overture IDs, are registered to the Global Entity Reference System (GERS). Overture IDs registered to GERS are intended to be stable &mdash; within a reasonable tolerance of error &mdash; across multiple Overture releases. When stability is not possible, we will attempt to provide traceability in a [GERS changelog](changelog).
