title: Stability by Feature Type

## Stability and traceability

Depending on the feature type, unique IDs registered to GERS are intended to be stable &mdash; within a reasonable tolerance of error &mdash; across multiple Overture releases. When stability is not possible, we will attempt to provide traceability in a [GERS changelog](../changelog). For example:

- a single road segment is bisected by a new road and becomes two road segments: 1 unique ID → 2 new unique IDs;
- a large building footprint is determined to be four smaller buildings when a higher resolution dataset becomes available: 1 unique ID → 4 new unique ID;
- a building is shifted 10 meters to the west when higher resolution imagery is made available: the unique ID is preserved for that feature.

The table below indicates which Overture feature types are intended to be stable from release to release.
