With each data release, Overture publishes a **GERS Registry** that serves as the single source of truth for all entities that are part of the Global Entity Reference System. It serves as a comprehensive catalog that tracks every stable ID ever published across all Overture data releases.

There is only ever one GERS Registry. It's not versioned. We update it with each release by comparing the last published GERS Registry with the current Overture data release. 

The registry is available as Parquet files at the following locations:

| Provider | Location |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Amazon S3 | `s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/registry/` |
| Microsoft Azure Blob Storage | `az://overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/registry/` |


## Registry schema

The GERS Registry files have the following schema:

| Column | Data type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | GERS identifier (UUID) |
| `version` | integer | current version number |
| `first_seen` | string | release when entity first appeared |
| `last_seen` | string | most recent release containing entity |
| `last_changed` | string | last release the entity was changed, sourced from changelog |
| `path` | string | relative path to feature in release data |
| `bbox` | struct(xmin float, xmax float, ymin float, ymax float) | bounding box coordinates | 


## Supported themes and types

The following feature types will be included in the initial GERS Registry (June 2025 release):

- `address`
- `building`
- `division`
- `division_area`
- `division_boundary`
- `place`
- `segment`
- `connector`

Inclusion in the GERS Registry signifies Overture's long-term commitment to entity matching and stability for those types. We may add additional feature types to the GERS Registry in future releases.


## Example

You can use the GERS Registry to verify that an entity exists in Overture, track the history of that entity, and find new entities that have been added. For example, you might ask, "Is `fea28f69-7afa-460c-b270-61ef74cd340c` part of GERS?" You can query the GERS Registry to find out.  

```
SELECT 
    *
FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/registry/*.parquet')
WHERE id='fea28f69-7afa-460c-b270-61ef74cd340c';
```

We can see that `fea28f69-7afa-460c-b270-61ef74cd340c` is a building first released by Overture in June 2025 and last seen in August 2025 (`2025-08-20.1`), the current release. The exact bounding box of the feature is `{'xmin': 80.67177, 'xmax': 80.67182, 'ymin': 26.619795, 'ymax': 26.619843}` and the relative path to the feature is `/theme=buildings/type=building/part-00149-8a741876-e04d-4e66-bc96-0171910fa1b1-c000.zstd.parquet`. You can directly access the Parquet file that contains this feature by appending the relative path to the current release path: `s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2025-08-20.1`. Since you know the exact bounding box of the feature, you can optimize your query and you should be able to fetch this feature directly from the data release in seconds.
