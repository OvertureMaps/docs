## Understanding GERS

Overture's Global Entity Reference System (GERS) is a framework for structuring, encoding and matching map data to a shared universal reference. Overture is building this common ID system to solve the difficult problem of integrating geospatial datasets; to make it easier to share and sell map data; and to enable cooperation among companies, non-profits, government agencies and other organizations.

All features in Overture Maps have unique IDs. For some feature types, the unique ID is registered with the Global Entity Reference System (GERS). GERS provides a mechanism to conflate datasets, matching one or more features via those unique IDs. For example, two geospatial datasets each containing a polygon that represents the footprint of the Empire State Building in New York City can be easily matched because both polygons will reference the same ID in GERS. A conflated dataset will then have a single polygon feature with one ID that represents the real-world entity known as "New York's Empire State Building."

## What is an entity?
Overture Maps defines an entity as a physical thing or concept in the real world, represented as a feature in a geospatial dataset. It could be a segment of road, a city boundary, a grocery store, a building or a park. Overture Maps assigns unique IDs to these features. In most cases it's helpful to think of an entity and a feature as the same thing, but in practice it can be more complicated. An entity in the world could be represented by multiple features in a dataset, and a feature in a dataset might be a representation of multiple entities in the world. For example, a school building and its entrances and exits might be considered a single entity in the world but could be represented as multiple features in a dataset, each feature with its own id.

## What does a unique id in Overture Maps look like?

Each unique id generated by Overture Maps is 128 bits. In this example, we can see five unique ids for five building type features in the Overture Maps May 2024 data release.

```sql
D SET s3_region='us-west-2';
D SELECT id FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-05-16-beta.0/theme=buildings/type=buiding/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1) limit 5;
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│                id                │
│             varchar              │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│ 08bf2a40219b0fff0200c394dae731bd │
│ 08bf35ad6a05afff0200e90ab3b011fa │
│ 08bf35ad6a058fff020009945ce09d65 │
│ 08bf35ad6a04efff02006264a736fc56 │
│ 08bf35ad6a04afff0200cf5e511a3f1b │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│             5 rows               │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Stability and Traceability

Unique ids registered to GERS are intended to be stable -- within a reasonable tolerance of error -- across multiple releases of Overture Maps data. When stability is not possible, Overture Maps will attempt to provide traceability. For example:

- a single road segment is bisected by a new road and becomes two road segments: 1 unique ID → 2 new unique IDs;
- a large building footprint is determined to be four smaller buildings when a higher resolution dataset becomes available: 1 unique ID → 4 new unique ID;
- a building is shifted 10 meters to the west when higher resolution imagery is made available: the unique ID is preserved for that feature

## Using GERS

Overture Maps intends for GERS to be used in two ways:

1. **Contributing data.** If an organization contributes data to the Overture Maps Foundation, our engineering team will match the features in that dataset to existing features in Overture Maps. Matched features can be assigned an existing id. New features may be assigned a new id registered to GERS.
2. **Associating data.** Users can independently conflate their own data with a current Overture Maps dataset, identifying matches among features in both datasets. Only the features that match an existing feature in the Overture Maps data can be assigned an id that is registered to GERS. The associated data will not become part of Overture Maps, but it will become GERS-enabled data, ready to be matched to any of the available datasets in the Overture Maps data ecosystem.
