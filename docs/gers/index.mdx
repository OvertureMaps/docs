## Understanding GERS

The Global Entity Reference System (GERS) is a framework for structuring, encoding, and matching map data to a shared universal reference. All features in Overture have a unique ID, and for some feature types those unique IDs, called Overture IDs, are registered to GERS and are intended to be [stable](stability). 

GERS provides a mechanism to match features across datasets. For example, multiple building features that each represent the footprint of the Empire State Building can be matched by ID if those features reference the same ID in GERS. 

## What does an Overture ID look like?

An Overture ID is 128 bits. In this example, you can see five unique IDs for building features from the June 2024 data release. [The IDs for the building feature type are registered to GERS](stability). 

```sql
D SET s3_region='us-west-2';
D SELECT id FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-06-13-beta.0/theme=buildings/type=buiding/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1) limit 5;
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│                id                │
│             varchar              │
├──────────────────────────────────┤

│ 08bf35ad6a04afff0200cf5e511a3f1b │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│             5 rows               │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Stability and traceability

Unique IDs registered to GERS are intended to be [stable](stability) &mdash; within a reasonable tolerance of error &mdash; across multiple Overture releases. When stability is not possible, we will attempt to provide traceability in a [GERS changelog](changelog). For example:

- a single road segment is bisected by a new road and becomes two road segments: 1 unique ID → 2 new unique IDs;
- a large building footprint is determined to be four smaller buildings when a higher resolution dataset becomes available: 1 unique ID → 4 new unique ID;
- a building is shifted 10 meters to the west when higher resolution imagery is made available: the unique ID is preserved for that feature.

## Using GERS

Here are two broad examples of using GERS.

1. **Associating data.** You can independently associate your own data or third-party data to Overture data. If features in your dataset match features in an Overture dataset, you can assign existing Overture IDs to the matched features. Your data is now GERS-enabled data, ready to be associated via Overture ID to any other GERS-enabled dataset in the Overture ecosystem.
2. **Contributing data.** If an organization contributes data to the Overture Maps Foundation, our engineering team will match the features in that dataset to features in Overture. Matched features may be assigned an existing Overture ID, and we may generate new Overture IDs for new features.
