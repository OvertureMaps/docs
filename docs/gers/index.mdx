## Unique IDs

Every feature in Overture is assigned a unique ID that is 32 characters and 128 bits. For some feature types, like `building` that unique ID is intended to be stable, release after release. 

Let's track two buildings in Berlin from Overture's [October 2023 alpha release](release/2023-10-19-alpha.0/) to now.

#### Reichstag buiding
| Overture release | `id` |
|------|----------|
| `2023-10-19-alpha.0` | `0881f1d4887fffff02ffffff7384db11` |
| `2023-11-14-alpha.0` | `08b1f1d488708fff0200bf6d40c1cf8f` |
| `2024-08-20.0` | `08b1f1d488708fff0200bf6d40c1cf8f` |

#### Brandenburg gate
| Overture release| `id` |
|------|----------|
| `2023-10-19-alpha.0` | `0881f1d4887fffff02ffffff7e214e74` |
| `2023-11-14-alpha.0`  | `08b1f1d488601fff020081deb18baf14` |
| `2023-12-14-alpha.0` | `08b1f1d488601fff02002aee6ba961a4` |
| `2024-08-20.0`| `08b1f1d488601fff02002aee6ba961a4` |

## Understand GERS

The Global Entity Reference System (GERS) is Overture's framework for using unique IDs to structure, encode, and match map data. GERS makes it possible to:

- [track the stability](stability) of features in Overture datasets
- [associate third-party data](gers-demonstrations) to features in Overture datasets
- [match features](gers-demonstrations) across Overture datasets and third-party datasets
- [detect changes and improvements](changelog) in Overture data from one release to another

## Using GERS

We envision the Overture community using GERS in these two general ways:

### Associating data
You can independently associate your own data (or another third-party dataset) with Overture data. This could mean associating real-time traffic data to Overture road segments, insurance data to Overture buildings, or restaurant reviews to features in Overture's places dataset. When this third-party data is matched to an Overture feature, it picks up the GERS ID assigned to that feature and is now "GERS-enabled data" that is ready to be associated via ID to any other GERS-enabled dataset in the Overture ecosystem.

### Contributing data
If your organization contributes data to the Overture Maps Foundation, our engineering team will match the features in your dataset to features in Overture. Matched features may be assigned an existing GERS ID, and we may generate new IDs for new features. 
 
You'll find theme-specific examples in the [GERS demonstrations](gers-demonstrations) section of this documentation.
