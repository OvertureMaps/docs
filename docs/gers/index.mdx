## Understanding the Overture ID System

The Overture ID System is a framework for structuring, encoding, and matching map data to a shared universal reference. All features in Overture Maps have a unique Overture ID.

Overture IDs provide a mechanism for matching features across datasets. For example, multiple building features that each represent the footprint of the Empire State Building in New York City can be matched if the features reference the same Overture ID. 

## What does an Overture ID look like?

An Overture ID is 128 bits. In this example, you can see the structure of Overture Ids for five features in the buildings dataset from the May 2024 data release. 

```sql
D SET s3_region='us-west-2';
D SELECT id FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-05-16-beta.0/theme=buildings/type=buiding/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1) limit 5;
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│                id                │
│             varchar              │
├──────────────────────────────────┤
│ 08bf2a40219b0fff0200c394dae731bd │

├──────────────────────────────────┤
│             5 rows               │
└──────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Stability and traceability

For some feature types, Overture IDs are intended to be stable &mdash; within a reasonable tolerance of error &mdash; across multiple releases of Overture data. When stability is not possible, we will attempt to provide traceability in a changelog. For example:

- a single road segment is bisected by a new road and becomes two road segments: 1 unique Overture ID → 2 new unique Overture IDs;
- a large building footprint is determined to be four smaller buildings when a higher resolution dataset becomes available: 1 Overture ID → 4 new Overture IDs;
- a building is shifted 2 meters to the west when higher resolution imagery is made available: the Overture ID is preserved for that feature.

## Using Overture IDs

Overture intends for its ID system to be used in the following ways:

1. **Associating data.** Users can independently conflate their own data with a current Overture dataset, identifying matches among features across datasets. A user can assign an Overture ID to features that match. The associated data will not become part of Overture, but it will become part of the Overture ID system, ready to be matched to any of the available datasets in the Overture data ecosystem.
2. **Contributing data.** If an organization contributes data to the Overture Maps Foundation, our engineering team will match the features in that dataset to existing features in Overture. Matched features may be assigned an Overture Id, and new features may be assigned a new Overture ID.
