## A unique ID

Each feature in Overture has a unique ID called an Overture ID. Overture IDs provide a mechanism for matching map data across multiple datasets. For example, we can match several building features, each representing the footprint of the Empire State Building in New York City, if those features reference the same Overture ID. 

## What does an Overture ID look like?

An Overture ID is 128 bits. In this example, you can see the structure of the Overture IDs for five features in the buildings dataset from Overture's May 2024 data release. 

```sql
D SET s3_region='us-west-2';
D SELECT id FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-05-16-beta.0/theme=buildings/type=buiding/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1) limit 5;
┌──────────────────────────────────┐
│                id                │
│             varchar              │
├──────────────────────────────────┤

```

## Stability and traceability

[For some feature types, Overture IDs are intended to be stable](stability) &mdash; within a reasonable tolerance of error &mdash; across multiple releases of Overture data. When stability is not possible, we will attempt to provide traceability in a changelog. For example:

- a single road segment is bisected by a new road and becomes two road segments: 1 unique Overture ID → 2 new unique Overture IDs;
- a large building footprint is determined to be four smaller buildings when a higher resolution dataset becomes available: 1 Overture ID → 4 new Overture IDs;
- a building is shifted 2 meters to the west when higher resolution imagery is made available: the Overture ID is preserved for that feature.

## Using Overture IDs

We intend for Overture IDs to be used in the following ways:

1. **Associating data.** Users can independently conflate their own data with a current Overture dataset, identifying matches among features across datasets. A user can assign existing Overture IDs to features that match. The Overture IDs make it possible to match that data to other datasets tagged with Overture IDs.
2. **Contributing data.** If an organization contributes data to the Overture Maps Foundation, our engineering team will match the features in that dataset to existing features in Overture. Matched features may be assigned an existing Overture ID, and new features may be assigned a new Overture ID.
