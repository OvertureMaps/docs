## Unique IDs

Every feature in Overture is assigned a unique ID of 32 characters and 128 bits. For some feature types, that ID is intended to be [stable](stability), release after release. For example, after the [July 2024 "General Availability" (GA) release](/release/2024-07-22.0/), an ID assigned to a `building` feature will not change, even if the building's properties change, including updates to its geometry. 

Let's examine the IDs for two iconic buildings in Berlin.

#### [Reichstag Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstag_building)
| Overture release | `id` | `change_type` |
|------|----------|------|
| `2024-07-22.0` | `08b1f1d488708fff0200bf6d40c1cf8f`| `data_added` |
| `latest` | `08b1f1d488708fff0200bf6d40c1cf8f` | `data_added` |

#### [Brandenburg Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Gate)
| Overture release | `id` | `change_type` |
|------|----------|------|
| `2024-07-22.0`| `08b1f1d488601fff02002aee6ba961a4`| `data_added` |
| `latest` | `08b1f1d488601fff02002aee6ba961a4`| `data_added` |

For both buildings, we can see the IDs are the same from the [GA release](/release/2024-07-22.0/) to the [latest release](/release). Because the building IDs are stable and unique, we can query the [changelog](changelog) by ID to detect changes in the features. The properties associated with both buildings were updated -- which often means improvements to the data -- in the GA release and the latest release. 

## Understand GERS

The unique, stable IDs assigned at the feature level form the basis of Overture's Global Entity Reference System (GERS). GERS is a mechanism for structuring, encoding, and matching map data that allows you to:

- [track the stability](stability) of features in Overture datasets by GERS ID
- [match features](gers-demonstrations) across an Overture dataset and a third-party dataset and assign GERS IDs to the matched features
- [associate third-party data](gers-demonstrations) to features in Overture datasets by GERS ID
- [detect changes](changelog) in Overture data from one release to another by querying the GERS changelog using the stable GERS IDs

## Using GERS

We envision the Overture community using GERS in two general ways:

### Associating data
You can independently associate your own data (or a third-party dataset) with Overture data. For example, you might want to link real-time traffic data to Overture road segments, insurance data to Overture buildings, or restaurant reviews to features in Overture's places dataset. When third-party data is matched to an Overture feature it picks up that feature's GERS ID and becomes "GERS-enabled" data, ready to be associated via ID to any other GERS-enabled dataset in the Overture ecosystem.

### Contributing data
You can contribute data to the Overture Maps Foundation, and our engineering team will match the features in your dataset to features in Overture. Matched features may be assigned an existing GERS ID, and we may generate new IDs for new features.
 
You'll find theme-specific examples of GERS use cases in the [GERS demonstrations](gers-demonstrations) section of this documentation.
