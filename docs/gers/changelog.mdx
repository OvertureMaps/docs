The [Global Entity Reference System](../) makes it possible to inspect changes in Overture data from release to release. Concurrently with the data, Overture generates a GERS changelog that captures feature-level changes linked to the feature's unique ID. This information can be used to guide decisions about data matching, better understand data stability, and help detect data errors. 

## Accessing the changelog

The GERS changelog is available as Parquet files &emdash; partitioned by theme, type, and change type &emdash; at following locations on Azure and AWS:

| Provider | Location |
| ------ | -------- |
| Amazon S3 | `s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/changelog/` |
| Microsoft Azure | `wasbs://changelog@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/` |

The latest path is: 
<QueryBuilder query="__OVERTURE_RELEASE/" language="text"></QueryBuilder>

## Types of changes

The types of changes in the changelog include:

- added: feature with this ID is new and was not present in the previous release
- removed: feature with this ID was present in the previous release, but not this release.
- data_changed: feature with this ID contains a change in geometry of properties from the feature with this ID in the previous release
- unchanged: feature with this ID in this release matches the geometry and attributes of the feature with this ID in the previous release

## Querying the GERS changelog

We can query the changelog with duckdb to get a quick look at changes in data from the last release to the current release. In this example, we're grabbing ID, feature type, and change type for buildings in several small cities across the [Amhara Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amhara_Region) in Ethiopia. 

<QueryBuilder query={changelog_buildings_churn}></QueryBuilder>

We can also get a count of building features by change type for our area of interest.

<QueryBuilder query={changelog_buildings_feature_by_change_type}></QueryBuilder>

Taking this one step further, this time using Athena to run our query, we can join the changelog and data via Overture ID to connect the change type and feature geometries and properties.  

<QueryBuilder query={changelog_buildings_join}></QueryBuilder>

Finally we can use the results of our query to visualize building features by change type and inspect the properties for each feature. The example below, created using [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/), shows buildings in [Finote Selam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finote_Selam), a city in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. The data is from Overture's `2024-06-13-beta.0` release, to which we added 100 million new buildings, many of them derived from satellite imagery by Microsoft.
