title: GERS Changelog
---

In the `2024-06-13-beta.0` release, Overture began publishing a GERS changelog to capture feature changes, via changes in Overture IDs, from one release to another. The GERS changelog is available as Parquet files &mdash; partitioned by theme, type, and `change_type` &mdash; at the following locations:
```
wasbs://changelog@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/2024-06-13-beta.0

s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/changelog/2024-06-13-beta.0
```

Valid values for the `change_type` include:
- added: Overture ID is new and was not in the previous release
- removed: Overture ID is not in the current release and was in the previous release
- data_changed: Overture ID is in the current release and was in the previous release and the feature's attributes or geometry have changed
- unchanged: Overture ID is in the current release and was in the previous release, and the feature's attributes and geometry have not changed
