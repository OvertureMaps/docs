With each data release, Overture publishes a changelog that capture changes in the data by the GERS ID for each feature. This information can be used to guide decisions about data matching, better understand data stability, and help detect data errors.

The data changelog is available as Parquet files &mdash; partitioned by theme, type, and change type &mdash; at the following locations:

| Provider | Location |
| ------ | -------- |
| Amazon S3 | `s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/changelog/` |
| Microsoft Azure | `wasbs://changelog@overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/` |

The latest path is:
<QueryBuilder query="__OVERTURE_RELEASE/" language="text"></QueryBuilder>

## Types of changes

The types of changes in the changelog include:

- **added**: the feature with this ID is new in the current release and was not present in the previous release
- **removed**: the feature with this ID is not present in the current release but was present in the previous release
- **data_changed**: the feature with this ID in the current release contains a change in geometry or properties from the feature with this ID that was in the previous release
- **unchanged**: the feature with this ID in the current release matches the geometry and properties of the feature with this ID that was in the previous release

## Querying the data changelog

We can query the changelog with DuckDB to get a quick look at changes in data from the last release to the current release. In this example, we're grabbing the GERS ID, feature type, and change type for buildings in several towns across the [Amhara Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amhara_Region) in Ethiopia.

<QueryBuilder query={changelog_buildings_churn}></QueryBuilder>

We can also get a count of building features by change type for our area of interest.

<QueryBuilder query={changelog_buildings_feature_by_change_type}></QueryBuilder>

Taking this one step further, this time using Athena to run our query, we can join the changelog and data via Overture ID to connect the change type and feature geometries and properties.

<QueryBuilder query={changelog_buildings_join}></QueryBuilder>

Finally we can use the results of our query to visualize building features by change type and inspect the properties for each feature. The example below, created using [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/), shows buildings in [Finote Selam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finote_Selam), a city in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. The data is from Overture's `2024-06-13-beta.0` release, to which we added 100 million new buildings, many of them derived from satellite imagery by Microsoft.
