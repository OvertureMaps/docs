title: Bridge Files

---

With each release Overture generates **bridge files** that connect GERS IDs to the IDs from the [source data](../attribution). These files are a key component of GERS and offer two critical capabilities: reverse lookup of source features and insight into Overture's conflation process. 

Here's how to get the bridge files:

| Provider | Location |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Amazon S3 | `s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/bridgefiles/<RELEASE>` |
| Microsoft Azure Blob Storage | `https://overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/bridgefiles/<RELEASE>` |

The latest Overture data `<RELEASE>` is: <QueryBuilder query="__OVERTURE_RELEASE/" language="text"></QueryBuilder>

## Partitioning and schema

Bridge files are released as Parquet files, partitioned by `dataset`, `theme`, and `type`. Overture currently provides mappings for the following datasets:

```
\bridgefiles
    \<RELEASE>
        **\dataset=OpenStreetMap**
            \theme=divisions
                \type=division
                \type=division_area
            \theme=buildings
                 \type=building
            \theme=transportation
                 \type=segment
        **\dataset=Esri Community Maps**
            \theme=buildings
                 \type=building
        **\dataset=PinMeTo**
            \theme=places
                 \type=places
        **\dataset=meta**
            \theme=places
                \type=places
        **\dataset=Microsoft**
            \theme=places
                \type=places
        **\dataset=Instituto Geográfico Nacional (España)**
            \theme=buildings
                \type=building
        **\dataset=geoBoundaries**
            \theme=divisions
                \type=division
                \type=division_area

```


| Property | Data type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| `id` | string | represents the GERS ID and is populated from the id column in the Overture data schema |

| `record_id` | string | represents the id of the feature as it is in the source data provider (e.g. n2757802019@9) and is populated by parsing the sources column in the Overture data schema |

| `update_time` | string | represents the time the feature or dataset was updated, depending on the data provider; also populated by parsing the sources column in the Overture schema |

| `dataset` | string | represents the name of the dataset the feature has been provided in; also populated by parsing the sources column in the Overture data schema |

| `theme` | string | represents the theme the feature is a part of, provided by the creator of the bridge file itself |

| `type` | string | represents the type of the feature, either derived from the data or provided by the creator of the bridge file |

| `between` | array<double> | represents the portion of the normalized length of the GERS feature the dataset way takes, represented by a range between 0 and 1 |

| `dataset_between` | array<double> | represents the portion of the normalized length of the dataset way the GERS feature takes, represented by a range between 0 and 1 |


## Using bridge files

Let's trace buildings data in the latest release back to the underlying source datasets. We'll examine an area near the US-Mexico border outside San Diego.

First, get the buildings in our area of interest:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS border_buildings AS
(SELECT
    *
FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2025-05-21.0/theme=buildings/type=building/*')
WHERE
bbox.xmin > -117.048198 AND bbox.xmax < -117.044608
    AND bbox.ymin > 32.535068 AND bbox.ymax < 32.600154);
```

Your table has 4367 building features in the latest release for your area of interest. Now let's look at a count of these building features by data source:

```
SELECT 
sources[1].dataset AS source,
count(*)    
FROM border_buildings
GROUP BY source;
```

```
┌────────────────────────┬──────────────┐
│         source         │ count_star() │
│        varchar         │    int64     │
├────────────────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Esri Community Maps    │          412 │
│ OpenStreetMap          │         1539 │
│ Google Open Buildings  │         1751 │
│ Microsoft ML Buildings │          665 │
└────────────────────────┴──────────────┘
```

Now use the bridge file to find additional source data from the Overture corpus that didn't make it into the release. Join the data from the release with the bridge file data to create a detailed view of the source mappings. _Remember: we only have bridge files for Esri Community Maps data and OpenStreetMap data._ 

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS border_buildings_corpus AS
(SELECT
  border_buildings.id AS gers_id,
  dataset,
  record_id AS dataset_record_id
FROM
  border_buildings
JOIN 
  read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/bridgefiles/2025-05-21.0/dataset=*/theme=buildings/type=building/*') bridge
ON border_buildings.id = bridge.id
ORDER BY border_buildings.id, bridge.dataset);
```

Notice that the bridge file results show 2,021 total records compared to 4,367 buildings in the original query. This is because we have incomplete bridge file coverage for buildings. We don't generate bridge files for Microsoft ML Buildings, Google Open Buildings, and Meta Buildings because those sources don't have meaningful IDs for reverse lookup. However, the source mappings that do exist for buildings reveal important patterns:

- Multiple sources per building: a single Overture building may be conflated from multiple source datasets
- One-to-many mapping: each source contribution gets its own bridge file record

Let's dig into this a bit more. We can identify the buildings in the release that have multiple sources mappings. 

``sql
-- Identify buildings conflated from multiple sources
SELECT gers_id, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT dataset) as source_count,
       STRING_AGG(DISTINCT dataset, ', ') as datasets
FROM border_buildings_corpus
GROUP BY gers_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT dataset) > 1;
```

There are 70 buildings with that are mapped to two data sources. 

```
┌──────────────────────────────────┬──────────────┬────────────────────────────────────┐

│             varchar              │    int64     │              varchar               │

│ 08b29a4c4280bfff02003a1e8ccaeb68 │            2 │ Esri Community Maps, OpenStreetMap │
...
```

Let's pull out one example:
| gers_id | dataset | dataset_record_id | update_time |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 08b29a4c428ebfff02002b827866f466 | Esri Community Maps | esri_ChulaVistaCA13510 | 2024-10-15T00:00:00.000Z |
| 08b29a4c428ebfff02002b827866f466 | OpenStreetMap | w1182486582@1 | 2023-06-16T14:22:10.000Z |

This shows that building `08b29a4c428ebfff02002b827866f466` was created by a conflation process that definitely included data from OpenStreetMap (way 1182486582, version 1) and Esri Community Maps (esri_ChulaVistaCA13510) and may have included other data sources that have not been mapped to GERS.


## Bridge file limitations

**Missing bridge files**: some datasets (Microsoft ML Buildings, Google Open Buildings, Meta Buildings) don't have bridge files because they lack meaningful source IDs for reverse lookup.

**Linear feature complexity**: transportation segments may have complex geometry relationships captured in the `between` and `dataset_between` fields

**Update frequency**: bridge files are generated per release and reflect conflation decisions at release time


Bridge files provide essential transparency into Overture's conflation process, enabling users to understand data provenance and trace features back to their source datasets.
