title: GERS Demonstrations
---

Overture member companies have created several GERS prototypes and examples to help you get started with data matching and GERS ID assignment. These demonstrations cover Overture's buildings, divisions, places, and transportation themes. 


### Esri

Esri, a general member of the Overture Maps Foundation, has taken the lead in creating and sharing examples of GERS-enriched data. In their initial GERS demonstration project following Overture's October 2023 release, Esri matched [Overture buildings with FEMA's USA structures](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/mapping/enriching-overture-data-with-gers/) in four cities and created an enhanced pop-up window showing the combined properties from both datasets for each feature, including the GERS ID and FEMA USA Structures UUID. More recently, Esri created a map showing [Overture buildings data enriched with the FEMA data for the Contiguouis United States (CONUS)](https://overture.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=52e3ebfaf01141d8bdfbaa06dcd96638).

Esri has also shared a feature layer combined data from the [Overture divisions theme, Census county geometries, and Census socioeconomic data (GERS ID to FIPS)](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=c640a11058e34316a69f6a1e74049f9e). 

### TomTom 

TomTom, an OMF steering committee member, shared a blog post about the importance of GERS in Overture's transportation data model: https://engineering.tomtom.com/overture-transportation-network-linear-referencing/


### Safegraph 

Safegraph, a contributing member company of OMF, wrote [a blog post and tutorial](https://www.placekey.io/blog/joining-overture-and-npi-datasets) about Placekey facilitating matches between Overture POIs and National Provider Identifier (NPI) data. The notebook associated with the tutorial is available here: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17BimmoiW4bqpyBb0-MdK2z9MwcSVAb-8?usp=sharing

### Precisely

Drew Breunig of Precisely, a contributing member of OMF, put togther a step-by-step guide to joining Overture buildings data to Census Block Group data using DuckDB:
