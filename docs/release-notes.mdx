# Release Notes: `2024-03-12-alpha.0`

Here are the highlights of what's new and updated in Overture's `2024-03-12-alpha.0` release. This release includes a schema change from `camelCase` to `snake_case` in the Admins theme, an expansion of GERS IDs across several themes and incremental updates to schema and datasets across all themes. Theme-specific highlights are available below.

 
## Breaking changes
In the Admins theme, we changed `camelCase` to `snake_case` for properties to be more compatible with some SQL engines. This may break your existing code and queries.

## Deprecations
Beginning with the April 2024 release, Overture will add a refactor of the Admins theme called Divisions to the schema and datasets. Admins and Divisions will coexist for three releases, at which point Divisions will fully replace Admins More information [here](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/discussions/117).
