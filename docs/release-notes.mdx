title: Release Notes
---


Here are the highlights of what's new and updated in Overture's `2024-03-12-alpha.0` release. This release includes a schema change to `snake_case` for attribute names in the Admins theme, an expansion of stable GERS IDs and incremental updates to the schema and datasets. More detailed [schema release notes and a changelog](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/releases/tag/v0.9.0) are available in the `OvertureMaps/schema`. 

 ### Breaking changes
In the Admins theme, we changed `camelCase` to `snake_case` for properties to be more compatible with some SQL engines. This may break existing code and queries.

### Deprecations
In the April 2024 release, Overture will implement a refactor of the `Admins` theme called `Divisions`. Admins and Divisions will coexist for three releases, at which point Divisions will fully replace Admins. More information on this change [here](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/discussions/117).
