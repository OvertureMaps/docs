title: Release Notes
---


Here are the highlights of what's new and updated in Overture's `2024-03-12-alpha.0` release. This release includes a schema change from `camelCase` to `snake_case` in the Admins theme, an expansion of GERS IDs across several themes and incremental updates to the schema and datasets.  

 ### Breaking changes
In the Admins theme, we changed `camelCase` to `snake_case` for properties to be more compatible with some SQL engines. This may break existing code and queries.

### Deprecations
In the April 2024 release, Overture will implement a refactor of the `Admins` theme called `Divisions`. Admins and Divisions will coexist for three releases, at which point Divisions will fully replace Admins. More information on this change [here](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/discussions/117).
