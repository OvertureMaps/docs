## Overview

The Overture Maps `base` theme provides the land and water features that are necessary to render a complete basemap. These features are currently derived from the [Daylight Earth Tables](https://daylightmap.org/earth/) schema and include the [Daylight Coastlines](https://daylightmap.org/coastlines.html). The theme includes five feature types:

- **`infrastructure`**: Infrastructure features such as communication towers and lines, piers, and bridges.
- **`land`**: physical representations of land surfaces derived from the inverse of OSM Coastlines; translates natural tags from OpenStreetMap.
- **`land_use`**: classifications of the human use of a section of land; translates landuse tag from OpenStreetMap.
- **`water`**: physical representations of inland and ocean marine surfaces; translates natural and waterway tags from OpenStreetMap.
- **`land_cover`**: derived from [ESA WorldCover](https://esa-worldcover.org/en), high-resolution optical Earth observation data.

## Schema design choices

- basic classification of features into `type`, `subtype` and `class` where appropriate.
- parsing and normalization of common OSM tags, such as `height` and `ele`.
- extraction of consistent OSM tags, such as `wikidata` to top-level properties.
- direct pass-through of remaining relevant OSM tags.
