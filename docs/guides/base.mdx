## Overview

The Overture Maps `base` theme provides the land and water features that are necessary to render a complete basemap. These features are currently derived from the [Daylight Earth Tables](https://daylightmap.org/earth/) schema and include the [Daylight Coastlines](https://daylightmap.org/coastlines.html).

## Schema design choices

- basic classification of features into `type`, `subtype` and `class` where appropriate.
- parsing and normalization of common OSM tags, such as `height` and `ele`.
- extraction of consistent OSM tags, such as `wikidata` to top-level properties.
- direct pass-through of remaining relevant OSM tags.

## Current feature types

- [infrastructure](https://docs.overturemaps.org/schema/reference/base/infrastructure): Infrastructure features such as communication towers and lines, piers, and bridges.
- [land](https://docs.overturemaps.org/schema/reference/base/land): physical representations of land surfaces. Global land derived from the inverse of OSM Coastlines. Translates `natural` tags from OpenStreetMap.
- [land_use](https://docs.overturemaps.org/schema/reference/base/land-use): classifications of the human use of a section of land. Translates `landuse` from OpenStreetMap tag from OpenStreetMap.
- [water](https://docs.overturemaps.org/reference/schema/base/water): physical representations of inland and ocean marine surfaces. Translates `natural` and `waterway` tags from OpenStreetMap.
