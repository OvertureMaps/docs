## Overview

The Overture Maps base theme provides the land, water, infrastructure, and bathymetry features that are necessary to render a complete basemap. The majority of these features come from OpenStreetMap. We classify OSM features into *type*, *subtype*, and *class* based on their tags. The land and ocean polygons are derived from the [Daylight Coastlines](https://daylightmap.org/coastlines.html). The theme includes six feature types:

- **`bathymetry`**: derived vectorized bathymetric data products from [ETOPO1](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/etopo-global-relief-model) and [GLOBathy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01132-9) data.
- **`infrastructure`**: Infrastructure features such as communication towers and lines, piers, and bridges from OpenStreetMap.
- **`land`**: physical representations of land surfaces derived from the inverse of OSM Coastlines; translates natural tags from OpenStreetMap.
- **`land_cover`**: derived from [ESA WorldCover](https://esa-worldcover.org/en), high-resolution optical Earth observation data.
- **`land_use`**: classifications of the human use of a section of land; translates landuse tag from OpenStreetMap.
- **`water`**: physical representations of inland and ocean marine surfaces; translates natural and waterway tags from OpenStreetMap.

Overture distributes its datasets as [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/), a column-oriented spatial data format that is a backwards-compatible extension of [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/). Parquet (and GeoParquet) is optimized for "cloud-native" queries, which means you can use many developer-friendly tools to efficiently fetch column "chunks" of cloud-hosted data. We encourage users who are new to GeoParquet to consult [this guide](https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/geoparquet/).

[The Getting Data section of this documentation](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/) offers instructions for using several tools to access Overture data, including DuckDB and Overture's Python command-line tool. See examples below for addresses.

We recommend querying and downloading only the Overture data you need.
If you have a particular geographic area of interest, there are several options for using a simple bounding box to extract address data.

## Schema design choices

- basic classification of features into `type`, `subtype` and `class` where appropriate.
- parsing and normalization of common OSM tags, such as `height` and `ele`.
- extraction of consistent OSM tags, such as `wikidata` to top-level properties.
- direct pass-through of remaining relevant OSM tags.
