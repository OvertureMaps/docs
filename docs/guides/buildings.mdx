## Overview

The Overture Maps `buildings` theme describes human-made structures with roofs or interior spaces that are permanently or semi-permanently in one place (source: [OSM building definition](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building)). The theme includes two feature types:
- **`building`**: The most basic form of a building feature. The geometry is expected to be the most outer footprint -- or roofprint if traced from satellite/aerial imagery -- of a building.
- **`building_part`**: A single part of a building. Building parts may have the same properties as buildings, including color, material, and shape. A building part is associated with a parent building via a `building_id`, if its geometry is contained within the building footprint.
