## Overview

The Overture Maps `buildings` theme describes human-made structures with roofs or interior spaces that are permanently or semi-permanently in one place (source: [OSM building definition](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building)). The theme includes two feature types:
- **`building`**: The most basic form of a building feature. The geometry is expected to be the most outer footprint -- or roofprint if traced from satellite/aerial imagery -- of a building.
- **`building_part`**: A single part of a building. Building parts may have the same properties as buildings. A building part is associated with a parent building via a `building_id`.

| column           | type    | description |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| id               | varchar | A feature ID that may be associated with the Global Entity Reference System (GERS) if—and-only-if the feature represents an entity that is part of GERS. |
| geometry         | blob    |  A building's geometry is defined as its footprint or roofprint (if traced from aerial/satellite imagery). MUST be a Polygon as defined by GeoJSON schema. | 
| bbox             | struct  | Area defined by two longitudes and two latitudes: latitude is a decimal number between -90.0 and 90.0; longitude is a decimal number between -180.0 and 180.0. |
| sources          | struct  | The array of source information for the properties of a given feature. Each source object lists the property in JSON Pointer notation and the dataset from which that specific value originated. | 
| subtype          | varchar | A broad category of the building type and purpose. | 
| names            | struct  | The name associated with the feature. The first entry in the array of names must have a "local" language. | 
| class            | varchar | Further delineation of the building's built purpose. | 
| level            | integer | The building feature's Z-order, i.e., stacking order. A Z-order of 0 is ground level. |
| has_parts        | boolean | Flag indicating whether the building has parts. | 
| height           | double  | Height of the building or part in meters. The height is the distance from the lowest point to the highest point. | 
| num_floors       | integer | Number of above-ground floors of the building or part. | 
| min_height       | double  | The height of the bottom part of building in meters. Used if a building or part of building starts above the ground level. | 
| min_floor        | integer | The "start" floor of a building or building part. Indicates that the building or part is "floating" and its bottom-most floor is above ground level, usually because it is part of a larger building in which some parts do reach ground level. | 
| facade_color     | varchar | The color (name or color triplet) of the facade of a building or building part in hexadecimal. | 
| facade_material  | varchar | The outer surface material of building facade. | 
| roof_material    | varchar | The outermost material of the roof. | 
| roof_shape       | varchar | The shape of the roof. | 
| roof_direction   | double  | Bearing of the roof ridge line. | 
| roof_orientation | varchar | Orientation of the roof shape relative to the footprint shape. Either "along" or "across." |
| roof_color       | varchar |  The color (name or color triplet) of the roof of a building or building part in hexadecimal. |
