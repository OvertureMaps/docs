_Country boundaries with region boundaries, July release_

## Purpose of the divisions

Divisions data can be used for many mapping purposes, which can include, but are not limited to: reverse-geocoding, cartographic styling of boundaries, and place labels. 

## Divisions feature types

- A `division` is a feature type that represents an official or non-official organization of people-- country, region, province, city, neighborhood, etc.-- as seen from a given political perspective. It has a `Point` geometry which gives an approximate location of the position most commonly associated with the feature.

- A `division_area` is a feature type that captures the shape of the land area, or land and territorial sea (maritime), belonging to a `division` feature. It has a `Polygon` or `MultiPolygon` geometry.

- A `boundary` is a feature type that represents a shared border between two `division` features. It has a `LineString` geometry. The geometry of a `boundary` is either wholly non-maritime, or wholly maritime. A maritime boundary is the extension of a non-maritime boundary into the water.

## Sources and licensing <a name="sources_and_licensing"></a>

As of the July 2024 release, Overture's divisions theme is comprised of data from the following sources:

- [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org/) ([ODbL-1.0 license terms]("https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright"))
- [geoBoundaries](https://geoboundaries.org/) ([CC BY 4.0 license terms]("https://www.geoboundaries.org/#tabs1-js"))

A full list of sources can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OvertureMaps/tf-data-platform/dev/datasets.json?token=GHSAT0AAAAAACPDIQJR2Y3W3QSK5ZMBTNEAZVCZS3Q), in JSON format.

## Pipeline migration to Overture <a name="pipeline_migration_to_overture"></a>

In late-2024, the Overture Maps Foundation is planning to migrate the conflation logic and pipeline code from member organizations to a public repository.

## Subtypes <a name="subtypes"></a>

The subtype field is used to represent each entity's administrative level, from `country` down to `microhood`. Subtypes can be used to represent a place hierarchy within a country and give data consumers a standardized place definition for divisions. A list of subtypes and their descriptions, below:

| Subtype  | Description | Example |
| -------- | -------- | ------- |
| **country** | Largest unit of independent sovereignty. | United States |
| **dependency** | A place that is not exactly a sub-region of a country but is dependent on a parent company for defence, passport control, subsidies, etc. | Puerto Rico |
| **macroregion** | A bundle of regions. These exist mainly in Europe. | Scotland; Île-de-France |
| **region** | States, provinces, regions. Largest sub-country administrative unit most countries, unless they have dependencies/macroregions. | Alaska; Alberta |
| **macrocounty** | A bundle of counties. Again, these exist mainly in Europe. | Inverness |
| **county** | Counties... Largest sub-region administrative unit in most countries, unless they have macrocounties. | Kings County, NY |
| **localadmin** | A level of government available in some parts of the world that contains localities or populated places that themselves have no authority. Often but not exclusively found in Europe. | Paris |
| **locality** | A populated place that may or may not have its own administrative authority. (It won't if it belongs to a localadmin.) | Taipei |
| **borough** | A local government unit, below the locality placetype. | Brooklyn, Queens, etc. |
| **macrohood** | A super-neighborhood that contains smaller divisions of type neighborhood. | BoCoCa (Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill, and Carroll Gardens) |
| **neighborhood** | A neighborhood. Most neighborhoods will be just this, unless there's enough granular division to warrant introducing macrohood and/or microhood divisions. | Cobble Hill |
| **microhood** | A mini-neighborhood that is contained within a division of type neighborhood. | Gätjensort in Hamburg |

## Data fields <a name="data_fields"></a>

As of the July 2024 divisions release, there are 25 unique fields in the divisions theme:

# Data access and retrieval <a name="data_access_and_retrieval"></a>

Overture's six data themes — including divisions — are freely available on both Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage at these locations:

| Provider | Location |
| -------- | -------- |
| Amazon S3 | s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/ |
| Azure Blob Storage | https://overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/release/ |

Overture distributes its datasets as [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/), a column-oriented spatial data format that is a backwards-compatible extension of [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/). Parquet (and GeoParquet) is optimized for "cloud-native" queries, which means you can use many developer-friendly tools to efficiently fetch column "chunks" of cloud-hosted data. We encourage users who are new to GeoParquet to consult [this guide](https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/geoparquet/).

Athena (AWS), Synapse (Azure), DuckDB, Sedona, and the Python command-line tool can all be used to view, query, and export Overture data. You can find detailed walkthroughs for each method, below:

- Athena (AWS): https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/athena-aws/
- Synapse (Azure): https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/synapse-azure/
- DuckDB: https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/duckdb/
- Sedona: https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/sedona/
- Python command-line tool: https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/overturemaps-py/

[This Overture doc](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/) describes the installation process in more detail.

## Authentication or authorization <a name="authentication_or_authorization"></a>

## Data retrieval examples <a name="data_retrieval_examples"></a>

### SQL

Using these simple queries, you can find the number of division entities and the number of entities per division type:
Find the total number of divisions entities

```
SELECT count(*)
FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-06-13-beta.0/theme=divisions/type=*/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1);
```

#### Find the total number of division type entities within the division theme

SELECT count(*)
FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-06-13-beta.0/theme=divisions/type=division/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1);

#### Find the total number of division_area type entities within the division theme

```
SELECT count(*)
FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-06-13-beta.0/theme=divisions/type=division_area/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1);
```

#### Find the total number of boundary type entities within the division theme

```
SELECT count(*)
FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-06-13-beta.0/theme=divisions/type=boundary/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1);
```

_Note: As of July 2024, the boundary type is now called division_boundary_

In the divisions dataset, each entity is maintained using a "subtype" - you can find an enumerated list here. You can further iterate on the queries above to find the number of entities per divisions theme, or the number of subtype entities per country.

#### List the number entities, per subtype in the division_area theme

```
SELECT count(*), subtype
FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-06-13-beta.0/theme=divisions/type=division_area/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)
GROUP BY subtype;
```

#### List the number entities, per subtype in the division_area theme in the US, Mexico, and Canada

```
SELECT count(*), subtype
FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-06-13-beta.0/theme=divisions/type=division_area/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)
WHERE country IN ('US','MX','CA')
GROUP BY subtype;
```

#### View information about a specific feature (US / Mexico boundary) without using a bounding box

```
SELECT *
FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-06-13-beta.0/theme=divisions/type=boundary/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)
WHERE id = '085db5bb7fffffff0173c9b945a8c25f';
```

#### Find the Overture record for a given OSM id (in this case, a relation)

```
SELECT *
FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-07-22.0/theme=divisions/type=division_area/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)
WHERE sources[1].record_id = 'R3766655';
```

#### View information about boundary features using a bounding box

To create a bounding box, find the southwest-most latitude/longitude and northeast-most latitude/longitde of the area you're interested in. For The US / Mexico border area, that would look something like:

    - Southwest-most point: 24.93478418, -119.13728323
    - Northeast-most point: 33.43995480, -95.63020817

Then, use these coordinates to develop the min and max values for your bounding box:

```
bbox.xmin > -119.13728323
bbox.xmax < -95.63020817
bbox.ymin > 24.93478418
bbox.ymax < 33.43995480
```

Now, use these coordinates to construct your query. This example returns results for the country boundary between the US and Mexico:

```
SELECT *
  FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-06-13-beta.0/theme=divisions/type=boundary/*', filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)
  WHERE bbox.xmin > -119.13728323
  AND bbox.xmax < -95.63020817
  AND bbox.ymin > 24.93478418
  AND bbox.ymax < 33.43995480
  AND subtype = 'country'
;
```

### Python

You can find Overture's official Python command-line tool here: https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py

This tool helps to download Overture data within a region of interest and converts it to a few different file formats. In this example, a bounding box is passed to obtain all divisions data around Boston, MA:

```
$ overturemaps download --bbox=-71.068,42.353,-71.058,42.363 -f geojson --type=divisions -o boston.geojson
```

Right now there is only one option to the overturemaps utility: download. It will download Overture Maps data with an optional bounding box into the specified file format. When specifying a bounding box, only the minimum data is transferred. The result is streamed out and can handle arbitrarily large bounding boxes.

Command-line options:

    - --bbox (optional): west, south, east, north longitude and latitude coordinates. When omitted the entire dataset for the specified type will be downloaded
    - -f (required: one of "geojson", "geojsonseq", "geoparquet"): output format
    - --output/-o (optional): Location of output file. When omitted output will be written to stdout.
    - --type/-t (required): The Overture map data type to be downloaded. Examples of types are building for building footprints, place for POI places data, etc. Run overturemaps download --help for the complete list of allowed types

This downloads data directly from Overture's S3 bucket without interacting with any other servers. By including bounding box extents on each row in the Overture distribution, the underlying Parquet readers use the Parquet summary statistics to download the minimum amount of data necessary to extract data from the desired region.
