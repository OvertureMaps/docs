title: Working with Overture divisions data
---

The Overture `divisions` theme includes features that represent human settlements in the real world, such as countries, regions, states, cities and towns. 


## Divisions feature types

- A `division` is a feature that represents an official or non-official organization of people-- country, region, province, city, neighborhood, etc.-- as seen from a given political perspective. It has a `Point` geometry which gives an approximate location of the position most commonly associated with the feature.
- An `area` is a feature that captures the shape of the land area, or land and territorial sea (maritime), belonging to a `division` feature. It has a `Polygon` or `MultiPolygon` geometry.
- A `boundary` is a feature that represents a shared border between two `division` features. It has a `LineString` geometry. The geometry of a `boundary` is either wholly non-maritime, or wholly maritime. A maritime boundary is the extension of a non-maritime boundary into the water.

     <li>`subtype`: **required**: the `division` type contains two subtypes, country and region.</li>
     <li>`local_type`: **optional**: string value indicating what the division is called locally, e.g. `subtype` might contain the normalized value "region" while `local_type` might be province, territory, state or "départment, for example.</li>
     <li>`names`: **required**: standard Overture names object.</li>
     <li>`hierarchies`: **required**: array of hierarchy arrays (defined below) containing the full descendant hierarchy (or hierarchies) of the `division`.</li>
     <li>`parent_division_id`: division ID of the division's default parent division; required for certain `subtype` values (e.g. a province, a neighborhood), not allowed for top-level `subtype` values (e.g. a country); the default parent division is the parent division seen from the default perspective, if there is one, and is otherwise chosen somewhat arbitrarily; the reason for having a single scalar-valued property here is also the reason for country and subdivision being scalar: to allow simple use cases to be simple.</li>
     <li>`country`: **required**: default [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) of the country or country-like entity the `division` represents or to which it belongs.
     <li>`region`: **optional**: default [ISO 3166-2 principal subdivision code](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html) for entities and the children of those entities. </li>

| Type | Geometry | Example | Properties |
| `division` | `Point` | Country, province, city, or neighborhood as seen from a given political perspective | 1. subType or divisionType: required enumerated type, e.g. country, region, county, locality, neighborhood similar to a Who's on First placetype—from a finite, ordered, hierarchical list—further details can be found below.
2. localType: optional string value indicating what the division is called locally, e.g. subType might contain the normalized value "region" while localType might be "province", "territory", "state", "départment", etc.
names: required standard Overture names object.
perspectives: optional non-empty array of political perspectives (defined below) documenting the political perspectives from which the division is seen.
hierarchies: required array of hierarchy arrays (defined below) containing the full descendant hierarchy (or hierarchies) of the division.
parentDivisionId: division ID of the division's default parent division; required for certain subType values (e.g. a province, a neighborhood), not allowed for top-level subType values (e.g. a country); the default parent division is the parent division seen from the default perspective, if there is one, and is otherwise chosen somewhat arbitrarily; the reason for having a single scalar-valued property here is also the reason for country and subDivision being scalar: to allow simple use cases to be simple.
country: required default ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code of the country or country-like entity the division represents or belongs to (a consequence of "or belongs to" is that all divisions, at any level of hierarchy, belonging to a parent country have the ISO country code repeated in this field); in some cases, a sub-country entity like Puerto Rico will have its own value in country ("PR") rather than the parent country's code ("US"); if more than one ancestor division is a country (e.g. in case of different political perspectives) the default country code is found by traversing the parentId chain up to the root.
subDivision: optional default ISO 3166-2 principal subdivision code for those entities that have one and children of those entities; not allowed for some subType values, e.g. a country; if more than one ancestor division is the top-level principal sub-division (e.g. in case of different political perspectives) the default country code is found by traversing the parentId chain up to the root.
norms: optional norms object (defined below) containing information about local rules and customs applicable in that division and any of its sub-divisions, for example driving side, official and primary languages, etc.
demographics: optional demographics object (defined below) containing information about the division's demographics, e.g. population.
wikidata: optional wikidata ID string; this is included to duplicate the existing structure but probably ought to be folded into a more generalized aliases or concordances property.
