## Overview

The Overture divisions theme has three feature types: `division`, `division_area`, and `division_boundary`.

There are more than 5.5 million point, line, and polygon representations of human settlements, such as countries, regions, states, cities, and even neighborhoods. The theme is derived from a conflation of [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) data and [geoBoundaries](https://www.geoboundaries.org/) data and is available under an [ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/) license. (See the [attribution page](https://docs.overturemaps.org/attribution/) for more information.)

Divisions data can be used for many purposes, which can include, but are not limited to:
- reverse-geocoding
- cartographic styling and map rendering
- place labels
- choropleth rendering
- containment checks (e.g. point-in-polygon analysis)
- choosing a geometry based on your use case

## Dataset description

### Feature type descriptions

A `division` is a feature type that represents an official or non-official organization of people: country, region, province, city, neighborhood, etc. &mdash; as seen from a given political perspective. It has a `Point` geometry which gives an approximate location of the position most commonly associated with the feature. We encourage you to consult the [schema reference documentation for the `division` feature type](/schema/reference/divisions/division).

A `division_area` is a feature type that captures the shape of the land area, or land and territorial sea (maritime), belonging to a `division` feature. It has a `Polygon` or `MultiPolygon` geometry. We encourage you to consult the [schema reference documentation for the `division_area` feature type](/schema/reference/divisions/division_area).

A `division_boundary` is a feature type that represents a shared border between two `division` features. It has a `LineString` geometry. The geometry of a `divison_boundary` is either wholly non-maritime, or wholly maritime. A maritime boundary is the extension of a non-maritime boundary into the water. Please consult the [schema reference documentation for the `division_boundary` feature type](/schema/reference/divisions/division_boundary).

### Subtype descriptions

Subtypes can represent each feature's administrative level, from `country` down to `microhood`. Subtypes can also represent a place hierarchy within a country and offer a standardized place definition for divisions. See below for a list of subtypes and their descriptions in the divisions theme:

<details>
	<summary>List of all subtypes in the divisions theme</summary>

| Subtype | Description | Example |
| -------- | -------- | ------- |
| **country** | Largest unit of independent sovereignty. | United States |
| **dependency** | A place that is not exactly a sub-region of a country but is dependent on a parent company for defence, passport control, subsidies, etc. | Puerto Rico |
| **macroregion** | A bundle of regions. These exist mainly in Europe. | Scotland; Île-de-France |
| **region** | States, provinces, regions. Largest sub-country administrative unit most countries, unless they have dependencies/macroregions. | Alaska; Alberta |
| **macrocounty** | A bundle of counties. Again, these exist mainly in Europe. | Inverness |
| **county** | Counties... Largest sub-region administrative unit in most countries, unless they have macrocounties. | Kings County, NY |
| **localadmin** | A level of government available in some parts of the world that contains localities or populated places that themselves have no authority. Often but not exclusively found in Europe. | Paris |
| **locality** | A populated place that may or may not have its own administrative authority. (It won't if it belongs to a localadmin.) | Taipei |
| **borough** | A local government unit, below the locality placetype. | Brooklyn, Queens, etc. |
| **macrohood** | A super-neighborhood that contains smaller divisions of type neighborhood. | BoCoCa (Boerum Hill, Cobble Hill, and Carroll Gardens) |
| **neighborhood** | A neighborhood. Most neighborhoods will be just this, unless there's enough granular division to warrant introducing macrohood and/or microhood divisions. | Cobble Hill |
| **microhood** | A mini-neighborhood that is contained within a division of type neighborhood. | Gätjensort in Hamburg |
</details>

### Data columns

The addresses GeoParquet file contains the following properties:

<details>
    <summary>Schema for the GeoParquet files in the divisions theme</summary>

| Property Name | Type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ------- |
| **id** |string | A feature ID. This may be an ID associated with the Global Entity Reference System (GERS) if—and-only-if the feature represents an entity that is part of GERS.
| **geometry** | blob | A WKB representation of the entity's geometry - a Point, Polygon, MultiPolygon, or LineString.
| **bbox** | array | The bounding box of an entity's geometry, represented with float values, in a `xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax` format.
| **version** | integer | Version number of the feature, incremented in each Overture release where the geometry or attributes of this feature changed.
| **sources** | array | The array of source information for the properties of a given feature, with each entry being a source object which lists the property in JSON Pointer notation and the dataset that specific value came from. All features must have a root level source which is the default source if a specific property's source is not specified.
| **subtype** | string | Category of the division from a finite, hierarchical, ordered list of categories (e.g. country, region, locality, etc.) similar to a Who's on First placetype.
| **wikidata** | string | A wikidata ID if available, as found on https://www.wikidata.org/.
| **population** | integer | Population of the division.
| **names** | array | A primary name of the entity, and a set of optional name translations. Name translations are represented in key, value pairs, where the key is an ISO language code and the value is the translated name.
| **class** | string | A value to represent whether an entity represents a `maritime` or `land` feature.
| **division_ids** | list | A list of the two division IDs that share this division boundary.
| **is_disputed** | boolean | Indicator if there are entities disputing this division boundary. Information about entities disputing this boundary should be included in perspectives property. This property should also be true if boundary between two entities is unclear and this is "best guess". So having it true and no perspectives gives map creators reason not to fully trust the boundary, but use it if they have no other.
| **perspectives** | array | Political perspectives from which this division boundary is considered to be an accurate representation. If this property is absent, then this boundary is not known to be disputed from any political perspective. Consequently, there is only one boundary feature representing the entire real world entity. If this property is present, it means the boundary represents one of several alternative perspectives on the same real-world entity.
| **local_type** | string | Local name for the subtype property, optionally localized. This property is localized using a standard Overture names structure.
| **country** | string | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code of the country or country-like entity, that this division represents or belongs to. If the entity this division represents has a country code, the country property contains it. If it does not, the country property contains the country code of the first division encountered by traversing the parent_division_id chain to the root.
| **region** | string | ISO 3166-2 principal subdivision code of the subdivision-like entity this division represents or belongs to. If the entity this division represents has a principal subdivision code, the region property contains it. If it does not, the region property contains the principal subdivision code of the first division encountered by traversing the parent_division_id chain to the root.
| **hierarchies** | Array | Hierarchies in which this division participates.
| **parent_division_id** | string | Division ID of this division's parent division. Not allowed for top-level divisions (countries) and required for all other divisions. The default parent division is the parent division as seen from the default political perspective, if there is one, and is otherwise chosen somewhat arbitrarily. The hierarchies property can be used to inspect the exhaustive list of parent divisions.
| **norms** | list | Collects information about local norms and rules within the division that are generally useful for mapping and map-related use cases. If the norms property or a desired sub-property of the norms property is missing on a division, but at least one of its ancestor divisions has the norms property and the desired sub-property, then the value from the nearest ancestor division may be assumed.
| **capital_division_ids** | array | Division IDs of this division's capital divisions. If present, this property will refer to the division IDs of the capital cities, county seats, etc. of a division.
| **capital_of_divisions** | list | Division ID of the division that this feature is the capital of. If present, this property will refer to the division IDs of a parent county, region, country, etc.
| **division_id** | string | Division ID of the division this area belongs to.
| **cartography** | array | Contains a prominence property, which offers a suggestion for displaying Overture features at specific zoom levels based on it's importance and significance.
| **is_land** | boolean | Indicates whether or not the feature geometry represents the non-maritime "land" boundary, which can be used for map rendering, cartographic display, and similar purposes.
| **is_territorial** | boolean | Indicates whether or not the feature geometry represents the full territorial boundary or claim of a feature.
| **filename** | string | Name of the S3 file being queried.
| **theme** | string | Name of the Overture theme being queried.
| **type** |  string | Name of the Overture feature type being queried.

## Data access and retrieval

Overture's divisions theme data is freely available on both Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage at these locations:

</Tabs>
Overture distributes its datasets as [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/), a column-oriented spatial data format that is a backwards-compatible extension of [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/). Parquet (and GeoParquet) is optimized for "cloud-native" queries, which means you can use many developer-friendly tools to efficiently fetch column "chunks" of cloud-hosted data. We encourage users who are new to GeoParquet to consult [this guide](https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/geoparquet/).

[The Getting Data section of this documentation](https://docs.overturemaps.org/getting-data/) offers instructions for using several tools to access Overture data, including DuckDB and Overture's Python command-line tool. See examples below for divisions.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Python Command-line Tool" label="Python Command-line Tool" default>
You can find Overture's official Python command-line tool [here](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py).

This tool helps to download Overture data within a region of interest and converts it to a few different file formats. In this example, a bounding box is passed to obtain all divisions data around Boston, MA:

```
overturemaps download --bbox=-71.068,42.353,-71.058,42.363 -f geojson --type=divisions -o boston.geojson
```

Right now there is only one option to the overturemaps utility: download. It will download Overture Maps data with an optional bounding box into the specified file format. When specifying a bounding box, only the minimum data is transferred. The result is streamed out and can handle arbitrarily large bounding boxes.

Command-line options:

- **--bbox** (optional): west, south, east, north longitude and latitude coordinates. When omitted the entire dataset for the specified type will be downloaded
- **-f** (required: one of "geojson", "geojsonseq", "geoparquet"): output format
- **--output/-o** (optional): Location of output file. When omitted output will be written to stdout.
- **--type/-t** (required): The Overture map data type to be downloaded. Examples of types are building for building footprints, place for POI places data, etc. Run overturemaps download --help for the complete list of allowed types

This downloads data directly from Overture's S3 bucket without interacting with any other servers. By including bounding box extents on each row in the Overture distribution, the underlying Parquet readers use the Parquet summary statistics to download the minimum amount of data necessary to extract data from the desired region.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="DuckDB" label="DuckDB" default>
First, follow the [setup guide for DuckDB](/getting-data/duckdb/).
<QueryBuilder query={ToParquet}></QueryBuilder>
Note: Running this query will result in a ~6.4GB file.
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Data usage guidelines

We recommend querying and downloading only the Overture data you need.
If you have a particular geographic area of interest, there are several options for using a simple bounding box to extract divisions data.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Overture Maps Explorer" label="Overture Maps Explorer" default>
To quickly view and download modest amounts of data, you can use the [Overture Maps Explorer website](https://explore.overturemaps.org/#15.07/41.89731/12.47626).

To download data: Pan to the area you are interested in, turn off the other layers, then click `Download Visible`.

This will download the area visible on your screen.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Python Command-line Tool" label="Python Command-line Tool" default>
First, follow the [setup guide for the Python Command-line Tool](/getting-data/overturemaps-py/).

You can alter the `bbox` value to download a particular area.

```
overturemaps download --bbox=-71.068,42.353,-71.058,42.363 -f geojson --type=divisions -o boston.geojson
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="DuckDB" label="DuckDB" default>
First, follow the [setup guide for DuckDB](/getting-data/duckdb/).

DuckDB allows you to pass a bounding box in your query to select features in a specified geogrpahic area.

This example returns results for the country boundary between the US and Mexico:
<QueryBuilder query={BorderUSMX}></QueryBuilder>
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Data manipulation and analysis

Using these queries, you can get counts for each feature type in divisions.
