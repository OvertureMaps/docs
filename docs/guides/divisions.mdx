## Divisions feature types

- A `division` is a feature that represents an official or non-official organization of people-- country, region, province, city, neighborhood, etc.-- as seen from a given political perspective. It has a `Point` geometry which gives an approximate location of the position most commonly associated with the feature.
- An `area` is a feature that captures the shape of the land area, or land and territorial sea (maritime), belonging to a `division` feature. It has a `Polygon` or `MultiPolygon` geometry.
- A `boundary` is a feature that represents a shared border between two `division` features. It has a `LineString` geometry. The geometry of a `boundary` is either wholly non-maritime, or wholly maritime. A maritime boundary is the extension of a non-maritime boundary into the water.
