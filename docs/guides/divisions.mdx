Overture Maps [has announced](/release/2024-04-16-beta.0) the deprecation of the `admins` theme, to be replaced with a new `divisions` theme. In the April 2024 release, the `divisions` schema became available to users; the `divisions` data became available in the May 2024 release. Both `admins` and `divisions` will coexist for the next two releases (June and July). In the August 2024 release, `admins` will be removed from Overture Maps. We encourage you to begin the transition to `divisions` now.

## Overview

The Overture Maps `divisions` theme includes features that represent human settlements in the real world, such as countries, regions, states, cities and towns.

## Divisions feature types

- A `division` is a feature type that represents an official or non-official organization of people-- country, region, province, city, neighborhood, etc.-- as seen from a given political perspective. It has a `Point` geometry which gives an approximate location of the position most commonly associated with the feature.
- A `division_area` is a feature type that captures the shape of the land area, or land and territorial sea (maritime), belonging to a `division` feature. It has a `Polygon` or `MultiPolygon` geometry.
- A `boundary` is a feature type that represents a shared border between two `division` features. It has a `LineString` geometry. The geometry of a `boundary` is either wholly non-maritime, or wholly maritime. A maritime boundary is the extension of a non-maritime boundary into the water.
