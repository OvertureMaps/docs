title: Overture + PMTiles
---

Overture is primarily distributed in the [GeoParquet format](/getting-data/#geoparquet). While GeoParquet is a compact format, **tiles** are essential for creating pannable, zoomable slippy maps for display on the web.

* Data is broken into **equal-sized square chunks** (tiles), to load only the visible data.
* Tiles are arranged in a pyramid by level of detail, enabling **zoomed-out overviews.**


## overture-tiles on GitHub

The [overture-tiles GitHub repository](http://github.com/overtureMaps/overture-tiles) contains scripts and programs to generate tilesets from Overture data. These tilesets are designed for an "X-ray" visualization like at **[explore.overturemaps.org](https://explore.overturemaps.org)** to aid in inspecting geometry and properties. **They are not designed to be a production-ready cartographic basemap.**

Each Overture theme is stored as a separate [PMTiles](https://github.com/protomaps/PMTiles) archive.

The individual tiles contain geometry and tags in the open [MVT](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec) vector tile format.

## Accessing Tiles

Overture Tiles are generated with each release. The current beta distribution of tiles are at this url:

`s3://overturemaps-tiles-us-west-2-beta/RELEASE/THEME.pmtiles`

Where `RELEASE` has the data minor version trimmed, e.g. `2024-08-20`, instead of `2024-08-20.0`.

These public S3 URLs can also be accessed via HTTP:

`https://overturemaps-tiles-us-west-2-beta.s3.amazonaws.com/RELEASE/THEME.pmtiles`

### Viewing Tiles

Local and remote HTTP URLs can be previewed at [pmtiles.io](https://pmtiles.io).

### Area Extracts

To create a new tileset for only part of the world, use the `extract` command of the [`pmtiles` CLI](https://github.com/protomaps/go-pmtiles).

To get all `buildings` tiles around Ghent, Belgium:

```
pmtiles extract https://overturemaps-tiles-us-west-2-beta.s3.amazonaws.com/2024-08-20/buildings.pmtiles ghent.pmtiles --bbox=3.660507,51.004250,3.784790,51.065996
```

## On AWS

The `overture-tiles` scripts can be automated with [AWS Batch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/), which generates the largest global tilesets in ~90 minutes using `c7gd.16xlarge` Ec2 instances on demand. Costs incurred include on-demand instances and S3 storage + transaction costs.

### Prerequisites

* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* [AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) `npm install -g aws-cdk`
* Docker Desktop

### Setup

1. Modify `bin/overture-tiles-cdk.ts`, specifying a different S3 bucket name.

2. From the `overture-tiles-cdk` repository:

```
npm run cdk bootstrap
npm run cdk deploy
```

3. Authenticate your Docker client with the provisioned AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) in the web console. Use **View Push Commands** to build the `Dockerfile` in the `overture-tiles` repository and push to ECR:

![explore.overturemaps.org](/img/overture-tiles-view-push-commands.png)

4. Submit jobs from the [AWS Batch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/batch/home#jobs) console. 

![explore.overturemaps.org](/img/overture-tiles-job-definitions.png)

  * Select from the available **Job Definitions**. Each Definition is associated with a version and theme from an Overture release.

  * Select the **OvertureTilesQueue** as the Job queue.

  * Input the **Command** as a JSON list: `["2024-08-20.0","my-bucket","addresses"]`

    * The first item is the release version, including minor version: `2024-08-20.0`

    * The second item is the target bucket: `my-bucket`

    * The third item is the theme: `addresses`

  * Once the job is complete, the tileset will be available at `s3://BUCKET_NAME/RELEASE/THEME.pmtiles`, e.g. `s3://mybucket/2024-08-20/addresses.pmtiles`

## On Your Workstation

### Requirements

* a Java Runtime Environment, version 22+, to build the `addresses`, `base`, `buildings` and `transportation` themes, along with `planetiler.jar` from [onthegomap/planetiler Releases](https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler/releases).
* the [felt/tippecanoe](https://github.com/felt/tippecanoe?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) tool and the [DuckDB CLI](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/) for other themes.
* the [aws CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) for downloading Overture data.

### Scripts

* Copy the Overture Parquet dataset to your local machine
  [using these docs](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/data/blob/main/README.md#how-to-access-overture-maps-data). If you want to only run on a small sample of data, you can use only the first `.parquet` file instead of all in the directory.

* for the `base`, `buildings` and `transportation` themes, generate the tileset with java:

```sh
# --data indicates where your Overture data is (overture/theme=base/...)
java -cp planetiler.jar profiles/Base.java --data=overture
```

The above command outputs `base.pmtiles` in the `data` dir.

* for other themes, run the theme script in `themes/`:

```sh
scripts/2024-08-20/places.sh overture places.pmtiles
```

This reads from Overture data in `overture` and writes `places.pmtiles`.

## Customization

The tilesets accompanying Overture releases are primarily for powering explore.overturemaps.org. For your own application, you may want to:

* Limit or modify the properties of each feature, to reduce the tile sizes.
* Change what features or properties are included at generalized lower zoom levels.

In these examples we'll work with a small area extract of Boston in the `boston/` folder, but all tiling methods can scale to the full dataset.

```sh
mkdir -p boston/theme=buildings/type=building
mkdir -p boston/theme=places/type=place
overturemaps download --bbox=-71.068,42.353,-71.058,42.363 -f geoparquet --type=building -o boston/theme=buildings/type=building/0.geoparquet
overturemaps download --bbox=-71.068,42.353,-71.058,42.363 -f geoparquet --type=place -o boston/theme=places/type=place/0.geoparquet
```

### Example: Places

The default `places.sh` script includes all Overture properties to aid inspection. To slim down the tile sizes, you can remove all the primary name in the `@name` field.

Modify [places.sh](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overture-tiles/blob/main/scripts/2024-07-22/places.sh) for the release matching your Overture data:

```sql
  ...
  json_object(
      'id', id,
      '@name', json_extract_string(names, '$.primary')
  ) AS properties,
  ...
```

```sh
./scripts/2024-07-22/places.sh boston boston_places.pmtiles
```

Inspect the created `boston_places.pmtiles` on [pmtiles.io](https://pmtiles.io) to see the slimmed-down properties:

![customized places tileset](/img/overture-tiles-customize-places.png)

### Example: Buildings

To reduce the size of tiles, the default Buildings script includes all properties only at zoom 13. Your own application may need this data at a lower zoom level.

Modify [`profile/Buildings.java`](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overture-tiles/blob/main/profiles/Buildings.java) to populate all Overture properties on zoom 12 instead of zoom 13:

```java
...
OvertureProfile.addFullTags(source, polygon, 12);
...
```

```sh
java -cp planetiler.jar profiles/Buildings.java --data=boston
```

Inspect the created `data/buildings.pmtiles` on [pmtiles.io](https://pmtiles.io) to see the additional properties on zoom level 12:
