import QueryBuilder from '@site/src/components/queryBuilder';
import HyderabadBuildingsAthena from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/queries/athena/hyderabad_buildings.sql';
import HyderabadBuildingsDuckDB from '!!raw-loader!@site/src/queries/duckdb/hyderabad_buildings.sql';

In this example, we'll query the Overture Maps buildings theme and download data for a specified bounding box. Then we'll load the data into [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/demo), an open-source tool for working with large map datasets, and visualize the buildings data by data source: [OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building), [Microsoft ML Building Footprints](https://github.com/microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints), and [Google Open Buildings](https://sites.research.google/open-buildings/).

Requirements: you'll need an AWS account and access to an S3 bucket if you want to use Athena. If you're using DuckDB (we recommend 0.10.0), you'll need to install and load the spatial and S3 or Azure extensions. You do not need an account on kepler.gl.

## Query the data in AWS Athena

Follow the [instructions for running the set-up queries](/getting-data/cloud-services) in Amazon Athena. Then you can run this in the Athena query console:

<QueryBuilder query={HyderabadBuildingsAthena}></QueryBuilder>

This outputs around 106,000 buildings in a table view that you can download as a CSV file.

## Query the data using DuckDB
Here's a similar query in DuckDB's flavor of SQL that outputs a GeoJSON file.

<QueryBuilder query={HyderabadBuildingsDuckDB}></QueryBuilder>

## Explore the data in kepler.gl 
Drag and drop the CSV or GeoJSON file into [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl/demo). Style the feature layer by choosing different colors based on the `primary_source` field. Then you can explore the data sources that Overture Maps conflated to create the buildings theme.
