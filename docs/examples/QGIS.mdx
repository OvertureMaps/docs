In this example, we'll show you how to get Overture Maps data into [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/), a powerful and popular open source geographic information system. QGIS can ingest almost every spatial data format, including [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/) and [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/). Once you get your data into QGIS, the sky's the limit for data analysis, data conflation, visualization and beautiful mapmaking. 

The trickiest part of this example is making sure you're installing a newer version of QGIS (with GDAL > 3.5) that can directly read `Parquet` and `GeoParquet` files. We'll walk you through the processs.

        <TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS" default>
            The [conda packages](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qgis) of QGIS have support for Parquet.

            You can find the latest installers for Mac here: [github.com/opengisch/qgis-conda-builder/releases](https://github.com/opengisch/qgis-conda-builder/releases)

            The [conda packages](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qgis) of QGIS have support for Parquet.

            Additionally, there is a Flatpak QGIS package that includes support for Parquet:

            ```bash
            flatpak install --user https://dl.flathub.org/build-repo/94031/org.qgis.qgis.flatpakref

## 1. Download Overture Data

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="DuckDB">

        Using only the `bbox` parameters, we can efficiently retrieve all Overture data without processing any geometries. With SELECT `*`, we will simply download _all_ of the data in Overture across all themes and types.

        ```sql
        LOAD httpfs;
        COPY(
            SELECT
		        *
	        FROM
		        read_parquet("s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-03-12-alpha.0/theme=*/type=*/*", filename=true, hive_partitioning=1, union_by_name=true)
	        WHERE
		            bbox.minX >= -105.30 AND bbox.minY >= 39.98
                AND bbox.maxX <= -105.24 AND bbox.maxY <= 40.07
        ) TO 'boulder_co_overture.parquet' WITH (FORMAT PARQUET);
        ```
        Note that this query gathers data from all Overture themes with `theme=*/type=*/*`. The resulting file has _all_ of the columns and multiple geometry types.


    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="DuckDB Spatial">

        The `spatial` plugin allows DuckDB to read the geometry and convert the file to a common spatial format. This query will download all of the `road` subtypes of `segments` in the `transportation` theme to a _shapefile_.

        ```sql
        LOAD spatial;
        LOAD httpfs;
        -- Roads
        COPY (
            SELECT
                names.primary AS name,
                JSON_EXTRACT(road, '$.class') AS class,
                ST_GeomFromWKB(geometry) as geometry
            FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-03-12-alpha.0/theme=transportation/type=segment/*',filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)
            WHERE
                subtype = 'road'
                AND bbox.minX > -122.679404 AND bbox.maxX < -121.978275
                AND bbox.minY > 47.360619 AND bbox.maxY < 47.786336
        ) TO 'seattle_roads.shp'
        WITH (FORMAT GDAL, DRIVER 'Esri Shapefile', SRS 'EPSG:4326');
        ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="Python">

        The new `[overturemaps-py](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py)` Python utility can download Overture data as both `geojson` and `geoparquet`. This example downloads buildlings around Boston.

        ```bash
        $ pip install overturemaps

        $ overturemaps download --bbox=-71.068,42.353,-71.058,42.363 \
            -f geoparquet --type=building --output=boston.geoparquet
        ```

        Note: run `overturemaps download --help` for a full list of types and output formats.

## 2. Clean the data

We need to clean the data and unpack values from the nested arrays in the attribute fields. This will make it easier for us to work with the data in QGIS.

More instructions TK.

## 3. Add the data to QGIS
All of the data files we created in Step 1 are vector files that can be added as layers in QGIS. The easiest method is to drag-and-drop the file(s) directly into the map canvas.
