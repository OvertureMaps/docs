title: Exploring Overture Data in QGIS

[QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/), an open source geographic information system can read a number of geospatial data formats. To read Overture data with QGIS, we just need to obtain the data we want in a format that is compatible with QGIS. Additionally, we recommend installing a version of QGIS with GDAL > 3.5 that can read `(geo)parquet`.

            The [conda packages](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qgis) of QGIS have support for Parquet.

            You can find the latest installers for Mac here: [github.com/opengisch/qgis-conda-builder/releases](https://github.com/opengisch/qgis-conda-builder/releases)

            Most distributions of QGIS for Windows have support for parquet.

            The [conda packages](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qgis) of QGIS have support for Parquet.

            Additionally, there is a Flatpak QGIS package that includes support for Parquet:

            ```bash
            flatpak install --user https://dl.flathub.org/build-repo/94031/org.qgis.qgis.flatpakref

## 1. Download Overture Data

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="DuckDB">

        Using only the `bbox` parameters, we can efficiently retrieve all Overture data without processing any geometries. With SELECT `*`, we will simply download _all_ of the data in Overture across all themes and types.

        ```sql
        LOAD httpfs;
        COPY(
            SELECT
		        *
	        FROM
		        read_parquet("s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-03-12-alpha.0/theme=*/type=*/*", filename=true, hive_partitioning=1, union_by_name=true)
	        WHERE
		            bbox.minX >= -105.30 AND bbox.minY >= 39.98
                AND bbox.maxX <= -105.24 AND bbox.maxY <= 40.07
        ) TO 'boulder_co_overture.parquet' WITH (FORMAT PARQUET);
        ```
        Note that this query gathers data from all Overture themes with `theme=*/type=*/*`. The resulting file has _all_ of the columns and multiple geometry types.


    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="DuckDB Spatial">

        The `spatial` plugin allows DuckDB to read the geometry and convert the file to a common spatial format. This query will download all of the `road` subtypes of `segments` in the `transportation` theme to a _shapefile_.

        ```sql
        LOAD spatial;
        LOAD httpfs;
        -- Roads
        COPY (
            SELECT
                names.primary AS name,
                JSON_EXTRACT(road, '$.class') AS class,
                ST_GeomFromWKB(geometry) as geometry
            FROM read_parquet('s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/2024-03-12-alpha.0/theme=transportation/type=segment/*',filename=true, hive_partitioning=1)
            WHERE
                subtype = 'road'
                AND bbox.minX > -122.679404 AND bbox.maxX < -121.978275
                AND bbox.minY > 47.360619 AND bbox.maxY < 47.786336
        ) TO 'seattle_roads.shp'
        WITH (FORMAT GDAL, DRIVER 'Esri Shapefile', SRS 'EPSG:4326');
        ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="Python">

        The new `[overturemaps-py](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py)` Python utility can download Overture data as both `geojson` and `geoparquet`. This example downloads buildlings around Boston.

        ```bash
        $ pip install overturemaps

        $ overturemaps download --bbox=-71.068,42.353,-71.058,42.363 \
            -f geoparquet --type=building --output=boston.geoparquet
        ```

        Note: run `overturemaps download --help` for a full list of types and output formats.

## 2. Add the data to QGIS
Add the data retrieved in the previous step to QGIS as you might any other vector layer. The easiest method is to drag-and-drop the file direclty into the application.
