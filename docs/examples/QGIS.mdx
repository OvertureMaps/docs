In this example, we'll show you how to get Overture Maps data into [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/), a powerful and popular open source geographic information system. QGIS can ingest almost every spatial data format, including [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/) and [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/). Once you get your data into QGIS, the sky's the limit for data analysis, data conflation, visualization and beautiful mapmaking.

    <summary>Instructions: Install a version of QGIS with GDAL > 3.5 that can read `(geo)parquet`</summary>

    <Tabs>
        <TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS" default>
            You can find the latest installers for Mac here: [github.com/opengisch/qgis-conda-builder/releases](https://github.com/opengisch/qgis-conda-builder/releases)

            Additionally, the [conda packages](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qgis) of QGIS have support for Parquet.

        <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
            Most distributions of QGIS for Windows have support for parquet.

        <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux" default>
            The [conda packages](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qgis) of QGIS have support for Parquet.

            Additionally, there is a Flatpak QGIS package that includes support for Parquet:

            ```bash
            flatpak install --user https://dl.flathub.org/build-repo/94031/org.qgis.qgis.flatpakref

## Download Overture Data

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="DuckDB">

        Using only the `bbox` parameters, we can efficiently retrieve all Overture data without processing any geometries. With SELECT `*`, we will simply download _all_ of the data in Overture across all themes and types. Note: if your query is interupted by a connection error, you might try running the following command first: `SET http_keep_alive=false;`.

        <QueryBuilder query={BoulderCoDuckDB}></QueryBuilder>

        Note that this query gathers data from all Overture themes with `theme=*/type=*/*`. The resulting file has _all_ of the columns and multiple geometry types.


    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="DuckDB Spatial">

        The `spatial` plugin allows DuckDB to read the geometry and convert the file to a common spatial format. This query will download all of the `road` subtypes of `segments` in the `transportation` theme to a _shapefile_.

        <QueryBuilder query={BoulderCoDuckDBSpatial}></QueryBuilder>

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="Python">

        The new [`overturemaps-py`](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py) Python utility can download Overture data as both `geojson` and `geoparquet`. This example downloads buildlings around Boston.

        ```bash
        $ pip install overturemaps

        $ overturemaps download --bbox=-71.068,42.353,-71.058,42.363 \
            -f geoparquet --type=building --output=boston.geoparquet
        ```

        Note: run `overturemaps download --help` for a full list of types and output formats.


    </TabItem>

## Add the data to QGIS
All of the data files we created in the previous step are vector files that can be added as layers in QGIS. The easiest method is to drag-and-drop the file(s) directly into the map canvas.
