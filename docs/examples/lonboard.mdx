In this example, we'll show you how to extract, process, and visualize Overture data for an area of interest using [Lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/) and the [Overture Maps Python command-line tool](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py). 

::: info
[Lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/) is a Python library that makes visualizing large map datasets in Jupyter notebooks fast and efficient. It's built on [GeoArrow](https://geoarrow.org/) and [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/), and works seemlessly with Overture's GeoParquet files so that you don't have to slow things down by converting to GeoJSON.
:::

As in previous examples, we'll be using [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/index.html) to handle the data. But instead of querying the data with DuckDB, we'll use the [Overture Python command-line tool](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py), built with Lonboard integration in mind. 

 You can view and download the complete notebook on [Notebook Sharing Space](https://notebooksharing.space/view/b63f6b3dda1da99c45caf53284fbc508aaae0a43480b43bb0316db636c5e6677).
 
 To follow along, you'll need to have [JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) running and the following dependencies installed:
 - [lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/#install)
 - [overturemaps-py](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py)
 - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
 - [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/index.html)
 - [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) 


``` python
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd
import overturemaps 
from shapely import wkb
from lonboard import Map, PolygonLayer
from lonboard.colormap import apply_categorical_cmap
```
Let's specify our bounding box. We like this free [bounding-box finder from Klokantech](https://boundingbox.klokantech.com/).

``` python
# specify bounding box
bbox =  -78.6429, 39.463, -73.7806, 41.6242
```
The Overture Python command-line tool accepts the feature type and bounding box.

``` python
# read in Overture Maps land_cover data type
table = overturemaps.record_batch_reader("land_cover", bbox).read_all()
table = table.combine_chunks()
```

``` python
# convert to dataframe
df = table.to_pandas()
```

``` python
# filter for higher resolution land_cover features
df_h = df[df.cartography.apply(lambda x: x['min_zoom'] == 8)]
```

``` python
# create color map for `land_cover` subtypes, loosely based on natural-color palette: https://www.shadedrelief.com/shelton/c.html
color_map = {
    "urban": [167, 162, 186],
    "forest": [134, 178, 137],
    "barren": [245, 237, 213],
    "shrub": [239, 218, 182],
    "grass": [254, 239, 173],
    "crop": [222, 223, 154],
    "wetland": [158, 207, 195], 
    "mangrove": [83, 171, 128],
    "moss": [250, 230, 160],
    "snow": [255, 255, 255],  
}
```

``` python
# apply color map to land_cover subtypes
colors = apply_categorical_cmap(df_h.subtype, color_map)
```

``` python
# DataFrame to GeoDataFrame, set crs
gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(
    df_h, 
    geometry=df_h['geometry'].apply(wkb.loads), 
    crs="EPSG:4326"
)
```

``` python
# create map layer 
layer = PolygonLayer.from_geopandas(
    gdf= gdf[['id','subtype', 'cartography', 'geometry']].reset_index(drop=True),
    get_fill_color=colors,
    get_line_color=colors,
)
```

``` python
#render map
view_state = {
    "longitude": -76.2,
    "latitude": 39.6,
    "zoom": 8,
    "pitch": 65,
    "bearing": 5,
}
m = Map(layer, view_state=view_state)
m
```
