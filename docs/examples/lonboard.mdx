In this example, we'll walk through three ways to fetch, process, and visualize Overture data in a Jupyter notebook using [Lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/) and the [overturemaps-py](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py) library. [Lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/) is a Python library that makes visualizing large map datasets in Jupyter notebooks fast and efficient. It's built on [GeoArrow](https://geoarrow.org/) and [GeoParquet](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html), which creates an opportunity for a fully binary workflow with Overture data.

    </summary>
To follow along with these examples, you should have [JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) running and the following dependencies installed:

- [Lonboard](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/#install)
- [overturemaps-py](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py)
- [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/index.html)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

</details>

The examples below are available in [the notebooks directory](//github.com/OvertureMaps/docs/tree/main/static/notebooks) in our docs repository on GitHub.

## Examples

In the first and simplest example, we'll use the [record_batch_reader](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py/blob/e9632d4d2481a472a22dfd2d0a47ec9798ced9ef/overturemaps/core.py#L17) method in the overturemaps-py library to load Overture GeoParquet data directly into a PyArrow table. Then we'll use lonboard's built-in visualization tools to create an interactive map.

### GeoArrow

 First, let's import our toolkit.

```python
import overturemaps
from lonboard import Map, PathLayer
```

Next we'll get a bounding box for our area of interest.

```python
# specify bounding box in Milan
bbox = 1.9402,48.7091,2.7784,49.0599
```

The `record_batch_reader` function accepts an Overture feature type and a bounding box as arguments. Let's grab some road data for Milan.

```python
# need feature type and bounding box as arguments
table = overturemaps.record_batch_reader("segment", bbox).read_all()
table = table.combine_chunks()
```

We can inspect shape of the data.

```python
table.shape
```

We can also dig into the complexity of the Overture transportation schema.

```python
table.schema
```

Lonboard includes many built-in tools for visualizing map data. Here we're using [PathLayer](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/api/layers/path-layer/) to render the segment features. Then we can set parameters for our interactive map display.

```python
layer = PathLayer(
    table=table.select(["id", "geometry", "subtype", "class", "names"]),
    get_color=[200, 0, 200],
    width_min_pixels=0.4,
)

view_state = {
    "longitude": 9.18831,
    "latitude": 45.464336,
    "zoom": 12,
}
m = Map(layer, view_state=view_state)
m
```

### GeoDataFrame (the long way)

In the second example, we'll add a few steps in the notebook to convert the PyArrow table to a GeoPandas GeoDataFrame. Getting the data into a GeoDataFrame can also require a bigger toolkit, depending on which methods we use. Here's our expanded toolkit:

```python
import overturemaps
import pandas
import geopandas as gpd
from shapely import wkb
from lonboard import Map, PolygonLayer
```

We'll use the same bounding box for Milan.

``` python
# specify bounding box
bbox = 1.9402, 48.7091, 2.7784, 49.0599
```

And we'll use the `record_bath_reader` method to pull the data into a PyArrow table. This time we'll grab buildings data.

``` python
# need feature type and bounding box as arguments
table = overturemaps.record_batch_reader("building", bbox).read_all()
table = table.combine_chunks()
```

Converting the table to a Pandas DataFrame is straightforward.

``` python
# convert to dataframe
df = table.to_pandas()
```

But we need an extra step to create the GeoDataFrame. Specifically we need to convert to the geometry to a [Shapely geometry](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/geometry.html) as we load into a GeoDataFrame.

``` python
# DataFrame to GeoDataFrame, set crs
gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(
    df,
    geometry=df['geometry'].apply(wkb.loads),
    crs="EPSG:4326"
)
```

We'll use Lonboard's [PolygonLayer](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/api/layers/polygon-layer/) to render the buildings. The we'll set the parameters for our interactive map display.

``` python

layer = PolygonLayer.from_geopandas(
    gdf= gdf[['id', 'geometry', 'names']].reset_index(drop=True),
    get_fill_color=[93, 103, 157],
    get_line_color=[0, 128, 128],
)

view_state = {
    "longitude": 9.18831,
    "latitude": 45.464336,
    "zoom": 13,
    "pitch": 45,
}
m = Map(layer, view_state=view_state)
m
```

### GeoDataFrame (the direct way)

In the last example, we'll use the [`geodataframe` method](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py/blob/e9632d4d2481a472a22dfd2d0a47ec9798ced9ef/overturemaps/core.py#L51) in the overturemaps-py library to pull Overture data directly into a GeoDataFrame. This method handles all the conversions internally, making our lives easier and our notebooks cleaner.

:::note
Until the `0.9.0` release of overturemaps-py is available, you'll need to follow these steps to use the `geodataframe` method: clone [overturemaps-py](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/overturemaps-py) and navigate into the directory; run `pip install -e .` in a new virtual environment to install the version with latest features; install the rest of the dependencies necessary for this example.
:::

Here's the toolkit:

```python
import geopandas
from overturemaps import core
from lonboard import Map, ScatterplotLayer
```

Once again, we'll use the bounding box in Milan.

```python
# specify bounding box
bbox = 9.106105, 45.427315, 9.263542, 45.5164
```

Direct to GeoDataFrame using the `geodataframe` method!

```python
# read in Overture place feature type, direct to geodataframe
gdf = core.geodataframe("place", bbox=bbox)
```

Use [ScatterplotLayer](https://developmentseed.org/lonboard/latest/api/layers/scatterplot-layer/) to render the point data and create an interactive map display in the notebook.

```python
# create map layer
layer = ScatterplotLayer.from_geopandas(
    gdf,
    get_fill_color=[0, 128, 128],
    radius_min_pixels = 1.5,
)

view_state = {
    "longitude": 9.18831,
    "latitude": 45.464336,
    "zoom": 13,
    "pitch": 45,
}
m = Map(layer)
m
```
