[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) is powerful analytics tool that allows you to query remote files and download only the data you want. You'll need to install at least [DuckDB 1.1.0](https://duckdb.org/2024/09/09/announcing-duckdb-110.html), which supports reading and writing geoparquet.

## Installation

[Install DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/). You'll need extensions to work with spatial data in the cloud. Run the following commands in the DuckDB command line:

1. `INSTALL SPATIAL;` to install the [duckdb_spatial](https://github.com/duckdblabs/duckdb_spatial) extension.
2. `INSTALL httpfs;` or `INSTALL azure;` to read from either Amazon S3 ([httpfs](https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/import/s3_import.html)) or Microsoft Azure Blob Storage ([azure](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/azure)).

## Downloading Overture Data

These SQL queries will access Overture data in the cloud and download only the attributes that you request.

<Tabs queryString="query">

<TabItem value="Places" label="Places">

Download all pizza restaurants in New York City as a `GeoJSON` file.

<QueryBuilder query={NewYorkPizza}></QueryBuilder>

See the [places schema](/schema/reference/places/place) to learn more about each attribute or the [common schema concepts](/schema/concepts/names/) to better understand `names.primary` from `names.common`.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Buildings" label="Buildings">

Access Overture buildings data hosted on Azure to download named buildings around Detroit, Michigan. Saves as newline-delimited GeoJSON.

<QueryBuilder query={DetroitBuildings}></QueryBuilder>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Roads" label="Roads">

Download all roads intersecting a given bounding box around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and save as GeoJSON.

<QueryBuilder query={ParisRoads}></QueryBuilder>
_Note: This will result in a GeoJSON file that contains all road segments that intersect the bounding box, not just road segments contained within the bounding box._
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Mountains" label="Mountains">

Download mountain peaks in Oregon, USA from the base theme, convert the elevation attribute to feet, and save the result as a GeoJSON file.

<QueryBuilder query={Peaks}></QueryBuilder>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Counties" label="Counties">

County-level geometries for Pennsylvania from the divisions theme and outputs a GeoPackage.

<QueryBuilder query={CountyGeometries}></QueryBuilder>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="geoparquet" label="As GeoParquet">

DuckDB v1.1.0 supports reading and writing GeoParquet directly. It recognizes the `geometry` type and will write the appropriate metadata.

<QueryBuilder query={WriteGeoparquet}></QueryBuilder>

DuckDB recognizes the input as geoparquet and will automatically cast the _geometry_ column to a `GEOMETRY` type.
The `COPY` command writes a parquet file of 100,000 places named `places.parquet` with the appropriate geoparquet metadata.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
To download the data as `shapefile`, replace the last line of any of the above queries:

```sql
) TO 'overture_data.shp' WITH (FORMAT GDAL, DRIVER 'ESRI Shapefile');
```

or as a `geopackage`:

```sql
) TO 'overture_data.gpkg' WITH (FORMAT GDAL, DRIVER 'GPKG');
```

The DuckDB Spatial extension supports more than [50 geospatial file formats](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/spatial.html#st_read--read-spatial-data-from-files).

You can also use DuckDB to loop over the Parquet files in a directory and convert the data to a spatial format of your choice. The spatial extension uses GDAL so you could export to flatgeobuf if that's the data format that works best for you. Here's a bash script that shows you how:

```bash
for f in *.parquet;
do duckdb -c \
"install spatial;
load spatial;
COPY (SELECT id, st_geomfromwkb(geometry) from read_parquet('$f'))
to '$f.fgb' WITH (FORMAT GDAL, DRIVER 'flatgeobuf');";
done
```

## Regional Extracts

We can use data from Overture's division theme to define our bounds for a regional extract.

This example stores the GERS ID for the division in the `division_id` variable. If you know the GERS ID, you can simply set it with: `SET variable division_id = '<GERS ID>'`.

If you don't know the ID, you can set the variable to the result of a query for that specific division, as shown here:


<QueryBuilder query={BuildingsInDivision}></QueryBuilder>

:::note
This query is broken into discrete steps for efficiency:

1. Using DuckDBs variables in the `WHERE` clause proved more performant than joining to the bounds table.
2. Storing the result first as GeoParquet and then converting to another format is significantly faster than doing it all in one step.

## Next steps

- Visualize the data in [QGIS](/examples/QGIS) or [kepler.gl](/examples/kepler-gl).
- [Make an interactive map](/examples/build-a-map).
- Consult one of our Data Guides to learn more about the data and for more advanced queries.
