## Overture Maps data release

Overture Maps data is distributed as GeopParquet files available on both Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. You do not need AWS or Azure accounts to access the data.

The data is available at the following locations:

| Provider | Location |
| ------ | -------- |
| Amazon S3 | `s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/` |
| Azure Blob Storage | `https://overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/release/` |

The latest release path is:
<QueryBuilder query="__OVERTURE_RELEASE/" language="text"></QueryBuilder>

We _strongly recommend_ accessing the data in the cloud by querying it either [locally](locally) or via [cloud services](cloud-services). This allows you to download only the subset of data you want:

## Accessing in the cloud

- [DuckDB (local)](locally)
- [Amazon Athena](cloud-services/#amazon-athena-aws)
- [Microsoft Synapse](cloud-services/#microsft-synapse-azure)

However, it is also possible to download the geoparquet files directly:

## Direct download

You can download the Parquet files directly from either Azure Blob Storage or Amazon S3 at the locations given above. **Note: the total size of all the files is over 200 GB.**

After installing the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), you can download the files from S3 using the below command. Set `<DESTINATION>` to a local directory path to download the files, or to an `s3://` path you control to copy them into your S3 bucket.

<QueryBuilder   query="aws s3 cp --region us-west-2 --no-sign-request --recursive s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/__OVERTURE_RELEASE/ <DESTINATION>"
                language="text">
</QueryBuilder>

You can download the files from Azure Blob Storage using [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer/) or the [AzCopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json#download-azcopy) command. An example `azcopy` command is given below.


<QueryBuilder   query='azcopy copy "https://overturemapswestus2.dfs.core.windows.net/release/__OVERTURE_RELEASE/" "<<local directory path>>"  --recursive'
                language="text">
</QueryBuilder>
