title: Getting Overture Data
---

import QueryBuilder from '@site/src/components/queryBuilder';

Overture's six data themes &mdash; [addresses](/guides/addresses), [base](/guides/base), [buildings](/guides/buildings), [divisions](/guides/divisions), [places](/guides/places), and [transportation](/guides/transportation) &mdash; are freely available on both Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage at these locations:

| Provider | Location |
| ------ | -------- |
| Amazon S3 | `s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/ <RELEASE>` |
| Azure Blob Storage | `https://overturemapswestus2.blob.core.windows.net/release/ <RELEASE>` |

We release data monthly. The latest `<RELEASE>` is:
<QueryBuilder query="__OVERTURE_RELEASE/" language="text"></QueryBuilder>

## GeoParquet

Overture distributes its datasets as [GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/), a column-oriented spatial data format that is a backwards-compatible extension of [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/). Parquet (and GeoParquet) is optimized for "cloud-native" queries, which means you can use many developer-friendly tools to efficiently fetch column "chunks" of cloud-hosted data. We encourage users who are new to GeoParquet to consult [this guide](https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/geoparquet/). Our [data guides](/guides) include the GeoParquet column descriptions for each feature type.

## Getting a small to medium amount of data (recommended)

If you're new to Overture data, we _strongly recommend_ starting with small to medium amounts of data. You can access the data using the services available in AWS and Azure, where the data are stored, or by using a locally-installed query engine like [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/). This allows you to download only the subset of data you want. You can also try Overture's experimental Python command-line tool to download data by feature type and area of interest. Or you can visually inspect all of Overture's data themes using our [Explore tool](https://explore.overturemaps.org/).

- [Overture's Python command-line tool](overturemaps-py)
- [Overture's Explore tool](https://explore.overturemaps.org/)
- [Amazon Athena](athena-aws) (account required)
- [Microsoft Synapse](synapse-azure) (account required)


## What if I want ALL the data?

:::warning
Are you sure? Each Overture GeoParquet file is ~1 GB and the total size of all the GeoParquet files is **>600 GB**.
:::

It is possible to download the GeoParquet files directly from either Azure Blob Storage or Amazon S3. Here's how you can do it:

After installing the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), you can download the files from S3 using the below command. Set `<DESTINATION>` to a local directory path to download the files, or to an `s3://` path you control to copy them into your S3 bucket.

<QueryBuilder   query="aws s3 cp --region us-west-2 --no-sign-request --recursive s3://overturemaps-us-west-2/release/__OVERTURE_RELEASE/ <DESTINATION>"
                language="text">
</QueryBuilder>

You can download the files from Azure Blob Storage using [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer/) or the [AzCopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-v10?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&bc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Fbreadcrumb%2Ftoc.json#download-azcopy) command. An example `azcopy` command is given below.

<QueryBuilder   query='azcopy copy "https://overturemapswestus2.dfs.core.windows.net/release/__OVERTURE_RELEASE/" "<<local directory path>>"  --recursive'
                language="text">
</QueryBuilder>
