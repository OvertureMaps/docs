As a series of GeoParquet files, Overture data is already optimized for distributed computing environments. The following example shows you how to work with Overture data in [Sedona](https://sedona.apache.org/), a cluster computing system for spatial data.

For this example, you can spin up a single-node Sedona Docker image from [Apache Software Foundation DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/sedona). In production, Sedona can be deployed to nearly any cloud environment (Databricks, AWS EMR, etc.), or check out [Wherobots](https://www.wherobots.com) to learn more about hosted  Sedona environments.


## Example
To get started with the single-node docker image, ensure your [docker](https://www.docker.com/) client is started, and then run:

```bash
docker pull apache/sedona
docker run -p 8888:8888 apache/sedona:latest
```

A Jupyter Lab and notebook examples is now available in your browser at [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/).

Create a new Python notebook with the following first cell:

<QueryBuilder query={SedonaSetup} lang="python"></QueryBuilder>

This will initialize your PySpark/Sedona environment and point it to the latest Overture data. Sedona knows the format is GeoParquet, so we can take full advantage of spatial queries.

For example, to find all of the places in Seattle, you can apply a spatial filter with the bounding box for Seattle:

```python
df.filter("""ST_Contains(
    ST_GeomFromWKT('POLYGON((-122.459681 47.734124, -122.224433 47.734124, -122.224433 47.481002, -122.459681 47.481002, -122.459681 47.734124))'),
    geometry)""").limit(100).show()
```

Or, find all of the places within 1km of the Space Needle with the following query:

```python
df.filter("""ST_DistanceSpheroid(
    ST_GeomFromWKT('POINT(-122.3493 47.6204)'),
    geometry) < 1000
""")
```

These are just examples to show you how to interface with Overture data in Sedona. Running this code locally on a single-node docker image will not see any performance benefits â€” but when deployed to the cloud, you can operate on the entire
