Below is a step-by-step guide on how to access and use Overture data in BigQuery:

## Before you begin

To get started using Overture data in BigQuery, you must create or select a Google Cloud project with billing [enabled](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/verify-billing-enabled#confirm_billing_is_enabled_on_a_project). BigQuery is automatically enabled in new projects, but in order to activate it in a preexisting project, you should enable the [BigQuery API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enableflow?apiid=bigquery&inv=1&invt=Abns8w).

## Getting Overture data in Google BigQuery

1. Log in to your [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Navigate to the **BigQuery** section by selecting `BigQuery` from the side menu or searching for it in the search bar.

3. In the BigQuery console, click **Add Data**. Then, click on **Public Datasets**.

4. The Google Cloud data marketplace will open. In the search box look for **Overture Maps**.

6. Back again in the BigQuery console you will see the `bigquery-public-data` project and the `overture_maps`dataset selected.

7. Our recommendation is that you add the `overture_maps` dataset or entirely the `bigquery-public-data` project in your starred selection in order to have access to the Overture data always at hand.

## Working with Overture data in BigQuery

1. Now that Overture Maps data is available in your BigQuery console, you can start using it. Note that in the `overture_maps` dataset you have access to all tables from all the different Overture Maps themes: Addresses, Base, Buildings, Divisions, Places and Transportation.

2. The release version is detailed as a `label` in each of the tables. You can check it out in the **Details** section of each table.

3. You can now query any of the tables directly from your SQL Editor in BigQuery. Here's one example for the Places data in Overture Maps.

    ![Overture data in Google Cloud](/img/getting-data/bigquery-11.png)

    ```sql
    -- Identify places within the "Restaurant" category
    SELECT id, phones.list[0].element AS phone, names.primary AS name
    FROM `bigquery-public-data.overture_maps.place`
    WHERE categories.primary = "restaurant"
    LIMIT 100;
    ```

## Additional notes

- **Updates**: CARTO regularly updates the Overture datasets in BigQuery and keeps the dataset synced with the last release. You can check the release version of the data as a metadata label in each table.
- **Support**: If you encounter issues accessing the data, contact CARTO support via [support@carto.com](mailto:support@carto.com).
