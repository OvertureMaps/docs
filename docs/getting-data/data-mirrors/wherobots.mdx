Wherobots is a cloud-native environment for geospatial data processing, powered by Apache Sedona. Their hosted notebook environments and data pipeline APIs allow you to work with massive geospatial datasets at scale. As an Overture Maps Foundation member, Wherobots maintains a mirror of all Overture Maps datasets in its cloud environment. Here's how you can access that data.

:::info
**Before you start** ensure that you have a free Wherobots Community Edition Organization or a paid Professional or Enterprise Edition Organization. For more information, see [Create a Wherobots Account](https://docs.wherobots.com/latest/get-started/create-account/#create-or-join-an-organization).

## Navigate to the Wherobots spatial data catalog

1. Log in to [Wherobots Cloud](https://cloud.wherobots.com/).

2. Go to the [spatial catalog](https://cloud.wherobots.com/spatial-catalog).

## Locate the Overture Maps database

1. In the sidebar, expand either the `wherobots_open_data` catalog or `wherobots_pro_data`. 

If you have a Wherobots Professional or Enterprise Edition Organization, you also have access to `wherobots_pro_data`, which includes datasets for enriching your analysis, such as US Census demographics and local weather events.

2. Within `wherobots_open_data`, expand the `overture_maps_foundation` database.

Here, you'll find Overture Maps tables, named according to Overture Maps theme and type: `{theme}_{type}`. For example, `buildings_building` is a table of the `building` type in the `buildings` theme and `transportation_segment` is a table of the `segment` type in the `transportation` theme. 


3. Select a table to view its detailed schema and confirm it contains the data you need.

Each table contains the following:
- catalog name
- catalog storage path
- database
- table name
- table schema
