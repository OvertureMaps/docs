This guide will show you how to access and work with Overture data in Wherobots. Wherobots is a cloud-native environment for geospatial data processing, powered by Apache Sedona. Wherobots provides hosted notebook environments and data pipeline APIs, allowing you to work with massive geospatial datasets at scale. Wherobots provides a fully hosted mirror of the Overture datasets.

## Accessing Overture Maps Data in Wherobots Cloud
To explore and query Overture Maps data within the Wherobots Cloud platform, follow these steps.

### Navigate to the Spatial Data Catalog

1. Log in to [Wherobots Cloud](https://cloud.wherobots.com/).

2. Go to the [Spatial Catalog](https://cloud.wherobots.com/spatial-catalog).

### Locate the Overture Maps Database

1. In the sidebar, expand either the `wherobots_open_data` catalog or `wherobots_pro_data`. 

If you have a Wherobots Professional or Enterprise Edition Organization, you also have access to `wherobots_pro_data`, which includes datasets for enriching your analysis, such as US Census demographics and local weather events.

2. Within `wherobots_open_data`, expand the `overture_maps_foundation` database.

Here, you'll find Overture Maps tables, including:
- `places_place`
- `buildings_building`
- `transportation_segment`

3. Select a table to view its detailed schema and confirm it contains the data you need.

Each table contains the following:
- Catalog Name
- Catalog Storage Path
- Database
- Table Name
- Table Schema

### Start a Wherobots Notebook
1. Return to the [Wherobots Cloud](https://cloud.wherobots.com/) homepage.
2. Select an available runtime to launch a new Notebook.
3. Once the runtime has loaded, open the Notebook.

## Loading Overture Data

You can load Overture Maps data using either the DataFrame API or SQL API:

### DataFrame API

So for example, you create a Wherobots dataframe with of the Overture Places dataset, you would do the following:

```python
# Load Places dataset
places_df = sedona.table("wherobots_open_data.overture_maps_foundation.places_place")

# Display sample data
places_df.show(5)
```

### SQL API
Or if you prefer Spatial SQL, you can use Spatial SQL syntax instead:

```python
# Load Overture Places data
places_df = sedona.sql("""
    SELECT * FROM wherobots_open_data.overture_maps_foundation.places_place
""")

# Create a temporary view
places_df.createOrReplaceTempView("places")

# Display sample data
places_df.show(5)
```
