# Data Mirrors

In addition to the official Overture sources on Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, several Overture Maps Foundation members and partners maintain mirrors of the data on cloud platforms. These mirrors let you access Overture data directly in your preferred cloud environment.

The mirrors are updated with each monthly Overture release, though there may be a slight delay from the official release date. The schema and structure of the data are maintained as close to the original as possible.

| Platform | Maintained by | Access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [BigQuery](/getting-data/data-mirrors/bigquery) | CARTO | Google Cloud Public Dataset Program |
| [Databricks](/getting-data/data-mirrors/databricks) | CARTO | Databricks Marketplace |
| [Fused](/getting-data/data-mirrors/fused) | Fused | Source Cooperative via Fused UDFs |
| [Snowflake](/getting-data/data-mirrors/snowflake) | CARTO | Snowflake Data Marketplace |
| [Wherobots](/getting-data/data-mirrors/wherobots) | Wherobots | Wherobots Spatial Catalog |

:::note
These are community-maintained resources. The official distribution on S3 and Azure remains the source of record.
