## 概要

Overture Maps 的建築主題描述了擁有屋頂或內部空間的人工建築，這些建築在某個地方是永久性或半永久性存在的（來源： [OSM 建築定義](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building)）。該主題包括兩種特徵類型：

- **`building`**: 最基本的建築特徵形式。幾何形狀預期為建築物的最外層足跡—如果從衛星/航空影像追蹤，則為屋頂印跡。建築物有一個布林屬性 `has_parts`，描述是否存在任何相關的建築部分。
- **`building_part`**: 建築物的一個部分。建築部分可能與建築物具有相同的屬性。建築部分通過 `building_id` 與父建築物相關聯。

Above is a visualization of San Diego, USA where multiple datasets are conflated. Notice how Esri and OSM buildings appear in big blocks while the Google and Microsoft buildings appear to mix together. This is a product of our conflation process that prioritizes community contributed data first and then "fills in" the rest of the map with the best ML data available.

Currently, the Overture buildings dataset is a combination of the following open building datasets:

| Source                     |  Type                 | Conflation <br /> Priority | Count    |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| [OpenStreetMap](//osm.org) | Community-contributed | 1                          |~600 Million  |
| [Esri Community Maps](https://communitymaps.arcgis.com/home) | Community-contributed | 2| ~14 Million |
| [Google Open Buildings](https://sites.research.google/open-buildings/)| ML-derived roofprints<br />  (&gt;90% precision) | 3|~400 Million |
| [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/GlobalMLBuildingFootprints) |ML-derived roofprints  | 4|~600 Million |
| [Google Open Buildings](https://sites.research.google/open-buildings/)| ML-derived roofprints<br />  (&lt;90% precision) | 5|~700 Million |

## Understanding the Parquet Files

| column           | type    | description |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| id               | varchar | A feature ID that may be associated with the Global Entity Reference System (GERS) if—and-only-if the feature represents an entity that is part of GERS. |
| geometry         | blob    |  A building's geometry is defined as its footprint or roofprint (if traced from aerial/satellite imagery). MUST be a Polygon as defined by GeoJSON schema. |
| bbox             | struct  | Area defined by two longitudes and two latitudes: latitude is a decimal number between -90.0 and 90.0; longitude is a decimal number between -180.0 and 180.0. |
| sources          | struct  | The array of source information for the properties of a given feature. Each source object lists the property in JSON Pointer notation and the dataset from which that specific value originated. |
| subtype          | varchar | A broad category of the building type and purpose. |
| names            | struct  | The name associated with the feature. The first entry in the array of names must have a "local" language. |
| class            | varchar | Further delineation of the building's built purpose. |
| level            | integer | The building feature's Z-order, i.e., stacking order. A Z-order of 0 is ground level. |
| has_parts        | boolean | Flag indicating whether the building has parts. |
| height           | double  | Height of the building or part in meters. The height is the distance from the lowest point to the highest point. |
| num_floors       | integer | Number of above-ground floors of the building or part. |
| min_height       | double  | The height of the bottom part of building in meters. Used if a building or part of building starts above the ground level. |
| min_floor        | integer | The "start" floor of a building or building part. Indicates that the building or part is "floating" and its bottom-most floor is above ground level, usually because it is part of a larger building in which some parts do reach ground level. |
| facade_color     | varchar | The color (name or color triplet) of the facade of a building or building part in hexadecimal. |
| facade_material  | varchar | The outer surface material of building facade. |
| roof_material    | varchar | The outermost material of the roof. |
| roof_shape       | varchar | The shape of the roof. |
| roof_direction   | double  | Bearing of the roof ridge line. |
| roof_orientation | varchar | Orientation of the roof shape relative to the footprint shape. Either "along" or "across." |
| roof_color       | varchar |  The color (name or color triplet) of the roof of a building or building part in hexadecimal. |
