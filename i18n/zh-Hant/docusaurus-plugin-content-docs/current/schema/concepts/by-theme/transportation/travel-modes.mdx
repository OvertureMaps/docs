在現實世界中，旅行模式可以直觀地理解為從點 A 到點 B 的方式。旅行模式可以包括非車輛模式（步行）、車輛模式（自行車或汽車），以及偶爾更具體的細節，例如被分類為高乘載車輛或重型貨車的汽車。

在 Overture 運輸主題模式中，這種現實世界的直觀理解轉化為以下定義：旅行模式是指一個人或物品可以使用 [段落](/schema/reference/transportation/segment) 特徵的被認可模式。

## 理解旅行模式

### 隱含的旅行模式

每個段落都有一組*隱含*的旅行模式，這些模式被允許使用該段落。對於 [道路](/schema/concepts/by-theme/transportation/roads) 段落來說，這組隱含模式源自 [道路類別](/schema/concepts/by-theme/transportation/roads#road-class)，以及該道路段落所在位置的地方規則、規範和習俗。

由於這組隱含模式取決於地區或司法管轄區，並且可能會隨時間而變化，Overture 運輸模式並未嘗試指定隱含模式。當這種詳細信息對於應用程序的正常運作很重要時，由具體應用程序來解決隱含模式。注意：一個準確的路由引擎可能需要這些信息，而 2D 地圖渲染或地理編碼器則可能不需要。

### 一般定義

Overture 的認可旅行模式以一般術語定義，這些術語廣泛適用，例如 `hov` 是高乘載車輛，`hgv` 是重型貨車。在大多數司法管轄區，這些通用術語對應到該地區使用的概念，即使該概念的當地名稱可能有所不同，例如一個地區可能稱為重型貨車，而另一個地區可能稱為大型貨車。

儘管廣泛適用，旅行模式在不同地區和不同時間可能有不同的定義。

- 在一個地區，`hgv` 可能指的是總重超過 3.5 噸（3,500 公斤）的任何車輛。在另一個地方，`hgv` 可能具有至少 10,001 磅的總重。
- 在一個地區，`hov` 可能要求至少有 2 名乘客，而在另一個地方，它可能有更高的最低乘客數，或包括電池電動車，或排除某些車輛或用途類別。

由於在地區和時間上的定義變化，Overture 僅提供旅行模式的一般定義，將精確定義留給那些需要它的應用程序。

### 什麼時候認可旅行模式？

當旅行模式成為 [`mode`](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/blob/5f82f1d6a916031cb32730e1fac7e1a353f10c60/schema/transportation/segment.yaml#L103) 列舉的一部分時，Overture 運輸模式會認可它。這個列舉在模式的早期版本中相對較小，只包含在各司法管轄區和時間上普遍適用的旅行模式。隨著模式的開發進展，這個列表已經擴展，並將隨著世界的變化和新信息的出現而繼續擴大。

Our criteria for recognizing a proposed new travel mode are:

- the proposed new travel mode should represent a generally-accepted
   concept meaning that the concept exists in many places with roughly
   the same definition.
- the proposed new travel mode should be referred to with well-known
   sign iconography or sign text in those jurisdictions where the
   concept exists; and this iconography or sign text is preferably
   somewhat consistent across many jurisdictions and over time.
- it must be possible to give a relatively precise definition to the
   proposed new travel mode and explain how it differs from, or
   *intersects* with, other similar travel modes which are already
   recognized in the Overture schema.
- the proposed new travel mode should preferably not be trivially
   expressible using another existing [scoping property](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules#scoped-values-and-scoping-properties).(*An example of such a trivially-expressible concept might be a three-axle vehicle which is more appropriately phrased as `vehicle: [{dimension: axle_count, comparison: equal_to, value: 3}]`.*)
- the proposed new travel mode must be supported by existing data in at
   least one of Overture's upstream data sources.

There is a risk that the above-described approach will be too slow to
adapt to our users' needs in a vast, ever-changing world. One possible
avenue to mitigate this risk is supporting [custom extensions](#should-we-support-extension-travel-modes) to the built-in list of recognized travel modes.

## Travel mode schema

### Scoping to travel modes

Travel modes can be used to change the scope of scoped and rule-based
properties within the schema. For example, they can affect the scope of access restrictions, turn restrictions, or speed limits on [road](/schema/concepts/by-theme/transportation/roads) segments. Since travel modes are expressed via scoping properties, we recommend you read the section on [scoped and rule-based properties](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules) before proceeding further.

#### Travel mode scoping: `mode`

The scoping property `mode` controls whether a given scoped property
applies when a given travel mode is being used for traveling along a
road segment.

If `mode` is provided, it must be a non-empty array of string values
identifying travel modes, and is interpreted as a set. Values must be
unique, but order is not important.

#### Vehicle attribute scoping: `vehicle`

Because travel modes are an fuzzy concept, there are inevitably areas
of overlap between with the more precise, but more limited, `vehicle`
scoping property which is used for [vehicle attributes scoping](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules#vehicle-attributes-scoping). Where there is potential overlap, the method of scoping used in Overture data releases will depend on how the upstream data source has expressed the equivalent concept. Where there is choice, it is preferable to select the scoping method that most accurately reflects the intention expressed on local signage.

#### Similar scoping properties: `using` and `recognized`

The scoping properties `using` and `recognized` express concepts that
are meant to be orthogonal to (completely separate from) travel modes.

- The `using` property indicates [purpose of use](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules#purpose-of-use-scoping) scoping, which relates to the purpose for which the person or thing travelling is using a given segment of the transportation network. Travel modes should ideally not embed a purpose of use.
- The `recognized` property indicates [status scoping](/schema/concepts/scoping-rules#status-scoping-membership-in-a-recognized-group), which relates to a recognized status given to the person or thing traveling, where the recognized status is distinct from the mode of travel itself. Travel modes should ideally not embed a status.

### The travel modes taxonomy

Travel modes in Overture form a shallow taxonomy. Some travel modes are
more general, while others are more specific, and a more general travel
mode may contain a more specific one. For example, the general travel
mode `vehicle` contains the more specific mode `motor_vehicle`. The
taxonomy supported in our draft schema `v0.8.0` can be visualized in the
diagram below.

As many of the above travel modes draw on the body of knowledge
accumulated in relation to OpenStreetMap
[transport mode access restrictions](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:access#Transport_mode_restrictions),
Overture Maps would like acknowledge a intellectual debt to the OSM community in
relation to travel modes as well as to other aspects of the transportation schema.

## Open questions

This section discusses some open questions we are debating internally with
regard to travel modes. We would love [your feedback](https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema/discussions) on these questions and any others you may have.

### Minimum required travel modes

We're not yet certain on the minimum set of recognized travel modes is
that will make the Overture transportation schema as usable as possible
to as broad an audience as possible. What do you think we are missing?

### Should we support extension travel modes?

<!--
TODO: This open question relates to the feature request
      https://github.com/OvertureMaps/schema-wg/issues/157.

      We should update or delete the content of this documentation based
      on what happens with that feature request.
-->

We live in a time of rapid technological and regulatory change in
the transportation space. No matter how quickly we extend the travel modes in the Overture Maps schema it will always be behind the real world with regard to some technologies, customs, or local rules.

One way to support users working at the cutting edge is to allow custom extensions to
the list of travel modes. If we did this consistently with how extension
properties <!-- TODO: This should be a link to a heading in the main
schema documentation, but that heading needs to be written first. -->
work for features, we could, for example, allow travel mode names with
the `ext_*` to be ignored by the schema validation rules.

### Internal consistency

In [another section of this documentation](#vehicle-attribute-scoping-vehicle), we alluded to an overlap between the fuzzy concept of travel modes and vehicle attribute
scoping. We're aware of this overlap and view it as limited but inevitable.

Our intention is to reduce or eliminate the overlap between travel modes and the other [similar scoping properties](#similar-scoping-properties-using-and-recognized)
(`using` and `recognized`). One area where we may have been unsuccessful
is the `emergency` travel mode in the [current taxonomy](#the-travel-modes-taxonomy).
Arguably, `emergency` should be removed from the taxonomy, and an
`as_emergency_responder` should be included in the status values enumeration for the `recognized` property.
